Its aim is to come up with solutions that will enable the cultural tourism to develop without excessively disturbing the daily rhythm of life of residents. The project involves researchers from the JU Faculty of Management and Social Communication.  The winners of the 2024–25 STEM Impact Award programme have been announced by the Polish-American Fulbright Commission. One of them is Dr hab. Jan Boroński, Prof. UJ from the JU Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, who will carry out a research project at the City University of New York.  On 11 December, the oldest Polish university received a delegation from Una Europa – an alliance of 11 leading European universities that aims to establish a close-knit inter-university environment, which would make full use of the potential of its member institutions. One of the goals of the visit was to plan the next year's General Assembly, which will be organised on 26–28 May by the Jagiellonian University as one of the Una Europa founding members.  Prof. Tomasz Guzik from the Faculty of Medicine at the JU Medical College entered the prestigious list of world’s most cited researchers as the only scholar affiliated with a Polish institution. The JU scholar has been listed in the cross-field category. His academic output consists of 368 publications, including 56 cited more than 100 times. Altogether, his works have so far been cited 24.5 thousand times.  On 5 December 2024 at a special session of the Jagiellonian University Senate, the title of doctor honoris causa of the oldest Polish university was awarded to the Prof. Peter Kleinebudde. The German scientist was recognised for his outstanding achievements in research and its application, including implementation of innovative projects in the area of design and production of more effective medications.  The need for and methods of creating at Polish universities a comprehensive, welcoming, and attractive academic environment for international researchers and their families was the topic of the Internationalisation Day \"EURAXESS – Developing Institutional Potential for Welcoming International Researchers\", which took place on 17 December at the Jagiellonian University.  On 21-22 November, the Jagiellonian University hosted a conference entitled ;(Meta-) Data Orchestration: Connecting Manuscript Collections for Innovating Research – \"Berlinka\" in Action'.

The research will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from Charles University in Prague and Eberhard Charles University in Tübingen.  Researchers from the JU Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology together with colleagues from Durham University and the John Innes Centre have achieved a breakthrough in understanding DNA gyrase. This enzyme, present in bacteria but absent in humans, plays a crucial role in supercoiling DNA, a necessary process for bacterial survival. Using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, the researchers reveal unprecedented detail of gyrase’s action on DNA, potentially opening doors for new antibiotic therapies against resistant bacteria.  A miner’s work carries a lot of risk. The conditions inside the mine tunnels are hard, including high temperatures, humidity, and noise. The miners also face a danger of explosion of the accumulated methane, which, consequently, needs to be removed from underground.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/studying-in-krakow", "text": "Kraków is one of the most prominent academic centres in Poland. With over 200,000 students coming to study here every year, it is not unreasonable to wonder what makes Kraków such an attractive place. While everyone certainly has their own individual reason, there are some which stand out amongst the others. Academic centre Ever since the Jagiellonian University was founded in 1364, Kraków has been known as a leading academic centre in Poland. Although there is a great number of respectable universities in our country, it is Kraków that immediately evokes images of student comradery and professors strolling through the streets of Old Town. This centuries-long academic tradition goes hand in hand with modern approach to education and state-of-the-art technology. For instance, Ruczaj, one of the districts located on the outskirts of Kraków, is rapidly transforming into a thriving centre of student activity thanks to the 3rd Campus of the Jagiellonian University. The fact that most higher education institutions in the city are sited near one another allows for a very close cooperation – not only scientific, but also related to culture and leisure. Booming job market Because Kraków's universities train highly qualified specialists in all kinds of fields, it is not at all surprising that businesses are very frequently set up in the region. International investors establish branches of their corporations in the area to ensure the influx of trained specialists. This offers prospective students a multitude of opportunities to develop careers in their desired professions. Perfect location Kraków's location is unique for several reasons. In addition to having all the benefits of a large city, including very well developed public transportation, easy access to hostels and student dormitories, and numerous shopping malls and restaurants, Kraków is also very close to the Tatra Mountains (with many ski resorts and trekking routes near Zakopane), beautiful national parks – Pieniny and Ojców, and Dunajec River Gorge, which offers some interesting rafting opportunities. Additionally, Kraków is not very far from other European capitals, such as Prague and Vienna, so weekend trips to neighbouring countries pose no problem to keen travellers. Kraków is also an important transport hub, with quick and comfortable bus, train and plane connections to other cities, both in Poland and abroad. City of kings Kraków is the historical capital of Poland, and as such, it is very deeply rooted in Polish tradition and culture. There is almost a tangible feel of history in the atmosphere of Kraków, while at the same time it is also very vivid and teeming with life. Galleries, museums, theatres, a philharmonic and an opera house – all these places offer unforgettable experiences to art aficionados. Small wonder that Kraków attracts thousands of tourists every year, regardless of season. The meeting place Despite its traditional nature, Kraków is not only about history. It is, first and foremost, a melting pot of diverse cultures, where people from all over the world meet to share their knowledge, experience, and friendship. Numerous clubs and pubs guarantee quality entertainment in a welcoming environment – be it in the open, spacious area of the Market Square, or mysterious, narrow alleyways of Kazimierz. Clubs are located close to one another, so hardened merrymakers may find themselves devoting entire evenings to exploring new places. Cultural, musical and film festivals, many of which are organised by students, also liven up the city. "}
{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/a-different-view", "text": " Jagiellonian University – the oldest Polish higher education institution, respected and esteemed, a symbol of Polish nation and science, an institution as integral to the history of Kraków as the Wawel Castle and St. Mary's Church. Almost every day, we unknowingly pass by places and people tied to the Jagiellonian University. For us, the university seems ageless and unchanging. However, if one decides to go off the beaten track and delve deep into the old archives in search of documents, photographs and pictures, one may discover a whole new image of the university: intriguing, fascinating, extraordinary. Such exploration is the purpose of the A Different View series. Collegium Novum is probably the most frequently photographed building of the Jagiellonian University. Located on the site of the pulled down Jerusalem boarding house, this representative edifice is the current head office of the university. And yet, the surrounding area looked very differently in the past. Read more here.   Collegium Maius is the oldest building of the Jagiellonian University. For several years after its foundation in 1364, Kraków's Alma Mater probably operated out of the Wawel Castle. The history of the edifice located at the intersection of ul. Św. Anny and ul. Jagiellońska begins a few years later, in 1400. Read more here.   Professors' Garden – a relatively small green area between Collegium Maius, Collegium Minus, Collegium Witkowski, and Collegium Novodvorscianum – was officially opened to visitors five and a half years ago. During its centuries-old history, this green enclave has gone through several periods of decline. Read more here.   The coat of arms of the Jagiellonian University – two crossed sceptres placed on a blue shield in background, topped with crown – is commonly known and visible in many places and contexts related to the Jagiellonian University. But if you raise your eyes you will see that the university buildings are adorned with many other coats of arms. What do they mean and why have they been placed there? Read more here.   There are very few objects which have accompanied humanity for as long as the clock. The first mechanical clock in Kraków was installed in the main square area in the late 14th century. The one in Collegium Maius is only a little younger. Read more here.   On 10 April, the JU Botanical Garden opened its gates for a new season. The garden, established in 1783, is the oldest of its kind in Poland. It was erected as part of the Hugo Kołłątaj's reform, which in the years 1777–1786 restructured the university and introduced into it the concepts of Enlightenment. The garden is widely recognised for its rich plant collection – and rightly so; however, it is unique in more than one way. Read more here.   "}

It has joined both the oldest European Coimbra Group network as well as the youngest European Universities Initiative within the framework of Una Europa alliance. The university has assisted the evolution of networks, especially over the last ten years. JU representatives have been also gradually joining or co-creating various networks evolving step by step in order to form deeper partnerships. As a result, those activities allow the university to implement more effectively principles of the University's strategy. Central coordination of JU participation in networks with a designated authority as well as administrative coordinator makes it easier to manage and harmonise all wide range of activities and thematic areas offered by the networks. It also helps finding and exploiting synergies between the networks.

In our philosophy and work we try to follow the ideas of tolerance and open-mindedness first spread in Poland by the royal Jagiellonian dynasty in the 14th-16th centuries. Student Centre for Support and Adaptation \"SOWA\" is a project of the Jagiellonian University and the University Hospital in Kraków addressed to Jagiellonian University students. In the centre you can talk to a qualified person about mental health problems affecting your studies, work or private life. You can also participate in thematic support groups. The offer is addressed not only to Polish, but also English-speaking students. Apart from experiencing challenges faced by the majority of young people starting their studies at universities (moving out of the family home, shaping their own identity, adapting to the role of a student, learning efficient time management), foreign students struggle additionally with culture shock, related to language barriers, homesickness, loneliness, and social differences. Participation in an adjustment support group will help you in preventing negative effects of the adjustment period and will give you tools to effectively deal with personal and academic issues in a foreign country. The role of the JU E-learning is to promote academic e-learning, to support new teaching methods and strategies and to offer assitance to university teachers in developing Internet-based classes and running them. The Centre focuses on: The Student Government consists of all Jagiellonian University students. The members of the Student Government are elected by the student community. The main task of the Student Government is to represent the interests of students. The tasks of the Department of Security, Safety and Equal Treatment include: The Queen Jadwiga Fund was established to commemorate the grand decision of the Queen who bequeathed her entire private wealth to restore the Kraków Academy and thus initiated 600 years of scholarly and teaching activity of the Jagiellonian University. The aim of the Fund is to aid scholars and PhD students from Central-Eastern Europe, former Soviet Union and the Balkan area, who plan to conduct their research in Kraków. The original creators of the Fund hope that this initiative will lead to closer ties between scholars from this part of Europe. The Fund’s aim is to support international students and high school graduates who cannot continue education in their home countries – due to the political situation there – and want to enrol in a programme of study conducted in Polish at the Jagiellonian University. It was instituted by the Rector’s governance together with the JU Senate to commemorate the scholarship’s Patron. Professor Franciszek Ziejka (1940-2020) was the JU’s honorary professor and former Rector of our university. An outstanding historian of Polish literature and internationally acclaimed researcher in European cultural tradition, as well as an admirer of Krakow’s antiquities, Prof. Ziejka has also been an active proponent of worldwide cooperation in arts and sciences.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/staff/staff-benefits/employee-capital-plans", "text": "What are the Employee Capital Plans (ECP)? Employee Capital Plans (ECP) are a voluntary and private long-term retirement saving system. How do the ECP work? The financial institution with which the employer sings agreements on operating and management of individual ECP accounts is chosen by the employer together with trade unions. Joint payments from the employer and employee are made to the account, along with the welcome payment and the annual benefit from the state. What are the Defined Date Funds? The Defined Date Fund is an investment fund within the framework of which the funds gathered in the Employee Capital Plans are invested. The particular sub-funds will follow different investment policies depending on the age of each participant. The older the employee, the safer financial instruments will be chosen to invest his or her funds. In practice, this means that the funds will be invested partly in shares and partly in debt (treasury bills, bonds, etc.). The percentage of funds invested in safer financial instruments will grow progressively along with the participant’s age. Is participation in the ECP obligatory? It is for the employer, but not for the employee. An employee is automatically enrolled in the programme, but he or she can leave it at any time, whereas an employer is obliged to participate, which means that when an employee is willing to participate, the employer’s share must be added to the employee’s account.  To whom are the ECP addressed? All employees no younger than 18 and no older than 55 are automatically enrolled in the programme. Employees between 55 and 70 years of age who want to join the ECP must submit a written declaration of their willingness to participate in the programme. Persons above the age of 70 cannot join the PPK (but those who were already participants of the ECP can continue their saving within its framework after reaching this age). How are contributions to the ECP made? An employee who joins the programme declares to make contributions of at least 2% of their gross salary, whereas an employer is mandated to contribute at least 1.5% of that gross salary. During the first year, the additional sum of 250 zlotys is transferred to the account (after at least 3 months of the employee’s participation), whereas the annual benefit from the state amounts to 240 zlotys. Can I increase or decrease the amount of my payments to the ECP? Yes, you can. The payment can be reduced to as little as 0.5% of gross salary if the employee’s monthly remuneration does not exceed 120% of the minimum monthly salary. The payment can also be increased by up to 2% of gross salary, which means that an employee can contribute from 2% to 4% of his or her gross salary (or, in special cases, from 0.5% to 4%).  What will be the monthly cost of my participation in the ECP? The basic cost is the declared percentage of gross monthly salary (default 2%) along with the income tax charged on the employer’s contribution (that is, on 1.5% of gross salary). Can I opt out from the programme? How can I do it? The ECP is a voluntary saving programme, so an employee can cancel his or her participation and leave the programme at any time. However, any employee who cancels participation in the ECP will be automatically enrolled in the programme every four years. If the person is still unwilling to make payments, he or she must submit another opt-out declaration. In the case of the University, which became subject to the Act on ECP of 1 January 2021, the first automatic re-enrolment of participants is  scheduled for the beginning of 2023, and will then be repeated every four years. When can I withdraw the money from the account? The ECP is a retirement saving programme, which assumes that all funds are withdrawn after the participant reaches the age of 60. The withdrawal process is divided into stages. 25% of the accumulated funds will be withdrawn at one time, and the remaining 75% - in monthly instalments during the following 10 years. This form of withdrawal after reaching the age of 60 will not entail any additional costs or taxation. An employee who, after receiving 25% of the accumulated funds, wishes to withdraw the remaining 75% in fewer instalments or all at once, will have to pay a tax charge. What if I would like to withdraw my money earlier? As participation in the ECP is not mandatory, the funds can be withdrawn at any moment, but this will entail additional charges. If the money is withdrawn before reaching the age of 60, the amount will be reduced by: The funds can be withdrawn without the deductions in exceptional situations, such as: What will happen to the accumulated funds if the participant dies before the age of 60? The funds accumulated in the ECP are fully inherited pursuant to the general rules of the Polish inheritance law. The beneficiaries can also be appointed by submitting the relevant decision to the investment fund. Will I be able to check the balance of my account? After joining the ECP, the investment fund will contact every participant providing him or her with the login and password to the system, enabling the participant to check the account balance, check how the funds are invested or, possibly, request changes in one’s personal data or investments. What if I have already been enrolled in the ECP by my previous employer? If a new employee was or is the ECP participant as part of another employment, he or she may transfer the previously accumulated funds to one specific investment fund of the selected employer or leave the money at two different investment funds and continue gathering them in two different accounts.

Its aim is to come up with solutions that will enable the cultural tourism to develop without excessively disturbing the daily rhythm of life of residents. The project involves researchers from the JU Faculty of Management and Social Communication.  The winners of the 2024–25 STEM Impact Award programme have been announced by the Polish-American Fulbright Commission. One of them is Dr hab. Jan Boroński, Prof. UJ from the JU Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, who will carry out a research project at the City University of New York.  On 11 December, the oldest Polish university received a delegation from Una Europa – an alliance of 11 leading European universities that aims to establish a close-knit inter-university environment, which would make full use of the potential of its member institutions. One of the goals of the visit was to plan the next year's General Assembly, which will be organised on 26–28 May by the Jagiellonian University as one of the Una Europa founding members.  Prof. Tomasz Guzik from the Faculty of Medicine at the JU Medical College entered the prestigious list of world’s most cited researchers as the only scholar affiliated with a Polish institution. The JU scholar has been listed in the cross-field category. His academic output consists of 368 publications, including 56 cited more than 100 times. Altogether, his works have so far been cited 24.5 thousand times.  On 5 December 2024 at a special session of the Jagiellonian University Senate, the title of doctor honoris causa of the oldest Polish university was awarded to the Prof. Peter Kleinebudde. The German scientist was recognised for his outstanding achievements in research and its application, including implementation of innovative projects in the area of design and production of more effective medications.  The need for and methods of creating at Polish universities a comprehensive, welcoming, and attractive academic environment for international researchers and their families was the topic of the Internationalisation Day \"EURAXESS – Developing Institutional Potential for Welcoming International Researchers\", which took place on 17 December at the Jagiellonian University.  On 21-22 November, the Jagiellonian University hosted a conference entitled ;(Meta-) Data Orchestration: Connecting Manuscript Collections for Innovating Research – \"Berlinka\" in Action'. It was the second in a series of international interdisciplinary conferences organised as part of the Flagship Project 'European Heritage in the Jagiellonian Library: Digital Authoring of the Berlin Collections. Core Facility (DiHeLib)', implemented within the framework of the strategic programme Excellence Initiative at the Jagiellonian University and coordinated by three units: the Faculty of Philology, the Jagiellonian Library, and the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy, and Applied Computer Science.  The latest issue of the prestigious Nature Communications journal features an article \"Systematic, computational discovery of multicomponent and one-pot reactions\", whose co-authors, working under the supervision of Prof. Bartosz Grzybowski, include Dr Sebastian Baś from the Department of Organic Chemistry at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Jagiellonian University.  The journal Advances in Colloid and Interface Science has published a paper summarising the results of the research carried out by a team led by Dr hab. Janusz Dąbrowski, Prof. UJ from the JU Faculty of Chemistry. The paper is a comprehensive study of innovative compounds activated by near-infrared (NIR) photons, which are currently being introduced in diagnostics and cancer treatments.  The latest issue of Nature journal features the article ‘Digestive contents and food webs record the advent of dinosaur supremacy’ co-authored by Dr Artur Górecki and Dr Grzegorz Pacyna from the Institute of Botany at the Faculty of Biology of the Jagiellonian University. The discussed research sheds new light on the evolution and diversification of dinosaurs and the reasons why they dominated terrestrial ecosystems for almost 150 million years.  The trilateral project Enhanced-field spectroscopy on photoactive hybrid metal-semiconductor nanostructures received almost two million zlotys in funding within the framework of the OPUS 26+LAP/Weave call. The Polish group is led by Prof. Kamilla Małek from the JU Department of Chemical Physics. The research will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from Charles University in Prague and Eberhard Charles University in Tübingen.  Researchers from the JU Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology together with colleagues from Durham University and the John Innes Centre have achieved a breakthrough in understanding DNA gyrase. This enzyme, present in bacteria but absent in humans, plays a crucial role in supercoiling DNA, a necessary process for bacterial survival. Using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, the researchers reveal unprecedented detail of gyrase’s action on DNA, potentially opening doors for new antibiotic therapies against resistant bacteria.  A miner’s work carries a lot of risk. The conditions inside the mine tunnels are hard, including high temperatures, humidity, and noise. The miners also face a danger of explosion of the accumulated methane, which, consequently, needs to be removed from underground. Despite many modern safety measures, the release of methane remains one of the key problems of mining industry, especially in the face of the planned EU directive effectively banning the emission of this gas to the atmosphere. Does this mean the end of methane emitting mines in Poland?  Can you present the essence of your research in just three minutes? Can you create a single, static slide that effectively conveys the core message of your doctoral dissertation? Are you able to explain your research to a general audience?

Almost every day, we unknowingly pass by places and people tied to the Jagiellonian University. For us, the university seems ageless and unchanging. However, if one decides to go off the beaten track and delve deep into the old archives in search of documents, photographs and pictures, one may discover a whole new image of the university: intriguing, fascinating, extraordinary. Such exploration is the purpose of the A Different View series. Collegium Novum is probably the most frequently photographed building of the Jagiellonian University. Located on the site of the pulled down Jerusalem boarding house, this representative edifice is the current head office of the university. And yet, the surrounding area looked very differently in the past. Read more here.   Collegium Maius is the oldest building of the Jagiellonian University. For several years after its foundation in 1364, Kraków's Alma Mater probably operated out of the Wawel Castle. The history of the edifice located at the intersection of ul. Św. Anny and ul. Jagiellońska begins a few years later, in 1400. Read more here.   Professors' Garden – a relatively small green area between Collegium Maius, Collegium Minus, Collegium Witkowski, and Collegium Novodvorscianum – was officially opened to visitors five and a half years ago. During its centuries-old history, this green enclave has gone through several periods of decline. Read more here.   The coat of arms of the Jagiellonian University – two crossed sceptres placed on a blue shield in background, topped with crown – is commonly known and visible in many places and contexts related to the Jagiellonian University. But if you raise your eyes you will see that the university buildings are adorned with many other coats of arms. What do they mean and why have they been placed there? Read more here.   There are very few objects which have accompanied humanity for as long as the clock. The first mechanical clock in Kraków was installed in the main square area in the late 14th century. The one in Collegium Maius is only a little younger. Read more here.   On 10 April, the JU Botanical Garden opened its gates for a new season. The garden, established in 1783, is the oldest of its kind in Poland. It was erected as part of the Hugo Kołłątaj's reform, which in the years 1777–1786 restructured the university and introduced into it the concepts of Enlightenment. The garden is widely recognised for its rich plant collection – and rightly so; however, it is unique in more than one way. Read more here.   "}
{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_US/studying-in-krakow", "text": "Kraków is one of the most prominent academic centres in Poland. With over 200,000 students coming to study here every year, it is not unreasonable to wonder what makes Kraków such an attractive place. While everyone certainly has their own individual reason, there are some which stand out amongst the others. Academic centre Ever since the Jagiellonian University was founded in 1364, Kraków has been known as a leading academic centre in Poland. Although there is a great number of respectable universities in our country, it is Kraków that immediately evokes images of student comradery and professors strolling through the streets of Old Town. This centuries-long academic tradition goes hand in hand with modern approach to education and state-of-the-art technology. For instance, Ruczaj, one of the districts located on the outskirts of Kraków, is rapidly transforming into a thriving centre of student activity thanks to the 3rd Campus of the Jagiellonian University. The fact that most higher education institutions in the city are sited near one another allows for a very close cooperation – not only scientific, but also related to culture and leisure. Booming job market Because Kraków's universities train highly qualified specialists in all kinds of fields, it is not at all surprising that businesses are very frequently set up in the region. International investors establish branches of their corporations in the area to ensure the influx of trained specialists. This offers prospective students a multitude of opportunities to develop careers in their desired professions. Perfect location Kraków's location is unique for several reasons. In addition to having all the benefits of a large city, including very well developed public transportation, easy access to hostels and student dormitories, and numerous shopping malls and restaurants, Kraków is also very close to the Tatra Mountains (with many ski resorts and trekking routes near Zakopane), beautiful national parks – Pieniny and Ojców, and Dunajec River Gorge, which offers some interesting rafting opportunities. Additionally, Kraków is not very far from other European capitals, such as Prague and Vienna, so weekend trips to neighbouring countries pose no problem to keen travellers. Kraków is also an important transport hub, with quick and comfortable bus, train and plane connections to other cities, both in Poland and abroad. City of kings Kraków is the historical capital of Poland, and as such, it is very deeply rooted in Polish tradition and culture. There is almost a tangible feel of history in the atmosphere of Kraków, while at the same time it is also very vivid and teeming with life. Galleries, museums, theatres, a philharmonic and an opera house – all these places offer unforgettable experiences to art aficionados. Small wonder that Kraków attracts thousands of tourists every year, regardless of season. The meeting place Despite its traditional nature, Kraków is not only about history. It is, first and foremost, a melting pot of diverse cultures, where people from all over the world meet to share their knowledge, experience, and friendship. Numerous clubs and pubs guarantee quality entertainment in a welcoming environment – be it in the open, spacious area of the Market Square, or mysterious, narrow alleyways of Kazimierz. Clubs are located close to one another, so hardened merrymakers may find themselves devoting entire evenings to exploring new places. Cultural, musical and film festivals, many of which are organised by students, also liven up the city. "}

Stasin and Niemen villas in the town of Rabka, currently used as staff guesthouses of the Jagiellonian University, were among three buildings that from June to August 1945 housed a Jewish children’s home, also known as a care and treatment centre. Each of the buildings accommodated at least several dozen boys and girls saved from the Holocaust. On 28 August 1945 the centre was closed down due to repeated antisemitic attacks posing danger the occupants’ lives. The children were evacuated to other care institutions. Jews were among the patients coming to Rabka health resort from its very beginning. One of the most visible groups of visitors were children, whose needs were catered for by specially created and adapted hotels and guesthouses. The greatest contribution to the popularity of Rabka health resort among Jews was made by summer camps for Jewish children, organised by the Association for Curative Summer Camps in Rabka, based in Kraków. Initiated by Kraków teacher Salomon Spitzer, they took place regularly from 1890 to the outbreak of the Second World War. Initially, children participating in the summer camps were accommodated in private lodgings, until 1907, when a dedicated building, funded by Maria and Wilhelm Frankl, started to be used. In the years to follow, it was successively remodelled and better adapted  to the needs of young patients. Besides the health resort visitors, Rabka also had its own local Jewish community. In the interwar period (1918–1939) it grew from over one hundred to about 450 people, which, combined with the temporary presence of and support from many more Jews visiting the resort, was enough to sustain basic Jewish institutions, such as a synagogue, a matzah bakery, a bathhouse, and a refuge for the poor and elderly. Regrettably, Jews in Rabka were affected by antisemitic sentiments that intensified in the 1930s, with some voices criticising the very presence of Jews in the health resort and the local press calling for economic struggle against them. The history of the Jewish Community in Rabka was brought to an abrupt end by the Second World War and the Holocaust, in which millions European Jews, including about 90 percent of Polish Jews, perished at the hands of Nazi Germans and their collaborators. In January and February 1945, which marked the end of military operations in the Małopolska region, the Jewish survivors started to emerge from hiding. They included orphaned children in need of care. One of the first places to accommodate them was the building of the Provincial Jewish Committee in Kraków at ul. Długa 38. Because of the health condition of most of the survived children, a need arose to create a proper care and treatment centre for the young patients, and a relevant plan based on pre-war experiences was prepared. Rabka was chosen as a natural location of such an institution, due to its pre-war status of a health resort popular with Kraków Jewry. Yet, the establishment of a Jewish orphanage in this town was by no means an easy task, both because of the lack of vacant buildings and an unfriendly attitude from local authorities and some local residents. Finally, the children’s home in Rabka, aimed to accommodate most severely ill young patients, was opened at the turn of June and July 1945. It consisted of three buildings – Stasin, Juras and Niemen villas, which provided quarters for one hundred children, mainly from Kraków, Warsaw, and Łódź. Unfortunately, during the very first weeks of their stay in Rabka, the children became target of attacks, which included throwing of a grenade into the Niemen villa one day after the Kraków pogrom of 11 August 1945. Fortunately, no one was hurt. The documents, found by Karolina Panz, who conduted research into the post-war history of Jews in the Podhale region, indicate that the assault was organised by students and teachers of Jan Wieczorkowski’s secondary school for men. The researcher claims that the threatening letters were allegedly authored by Rev. Józef Hojoł and anonymously delivered to the orphanage authorities by Mieczysław Klempka, known as ‘Kot’ (cat) – a leader of underground scout movement in the above-mentioned school. The messages contained threats of repression if the children do not leave Rabka. The second attack on the orphanage took place on 19 August 1945, when all three buildings were hit with machine gun fire and grenades. Another incident happened on 27 August. Again, there were no casualties. For unclear reasons, members of local police and state security service did not intervene. The officers from the town of Nowy Targ delegated to protect the children were also absent from the crime scene. On 28 August 1945, a decision to close down the Jewish orphanage in Rabka was made. The children who had parents or guardians were returned to them. Some orphans were relocated to children’s homes in Otwock and Bielsko. Those most badly ill and without any chances for receiving care from relatives were taken to an orphanage in Zakopane. The fear of further attacks turned out to be well founded, since at night on 28–29 August 1945 the Zakopane orphanage was fired at with machine guns. Fortunately, like during previous incidents, no one was injured, but in the following weeks the institution was subject to verbal attacks and written threats. As local security services refused to protect the children, the institution was closed down in mid-March 1946. The orphanage director decided that the children should be moved abroad.  On 18 March 1946 most children, accompanied by the staff and several soldiers, boarded a lorry, crossed the state border in Cieszyn and entered Czechoslovakia, from where they went to France. The children who stayed in Zakopane – 22 half-orphans or those under guardians’ care – went to Kraków together with one staff member. So ends the short and dramatic history of post-World War II Jewish children’s homes in Podhale.

On 11 December, the oldest Polish university received a delegation from Una Europa – an alliance of 11 leading European universities that aims to establish a close-knit inter-university environment, which would make full use of the potential of its member institutions. One of the goals of the visit was to plan the next year's General Assembly, which will be organised on 26–28 May by the Jagiellonian University as one of the Una Europa founding members.  Prof. Tomasz Guzik from the Faculty of Medicine at the JU Medical College entered the prestigious list of world’s most cited researchers as the only scholar affiliated with a Polish institution. The JU scholar has been listed in the cross-field category. His academic output consists of 368 publications, including 56 cited more than 100 times. Altogether, his works have so far been cited 24.5 thousand times.  On 5 December 2024 at a special session of the Jagiellonian University Senate, the title of doctor honoris causa of the oldest Polish university was awarded to the Prof. Peter Kleinebudde. The German scientist was recognised for his outstanding achievements in research and its application, including implementation of innovative projects in the area of design and production of more effective medications.  The need for and methods of creating at Polish universities a comprehensive, welcoming, and attractive academic environment for international researchers and their families was the topic of the Internationalisation Day \"EURAXESS – Developing Institutional Potential for Welcoming International Researchers\", which took place on 17 December at the Jagiellonian University.  On 21-22 November, the Jagiellonian University hosted a conference entitled ;(Meta-) Data Orchestration: Connecting Manuscript Collections for Innovating Research – \"Berlinka\" in Action'. It was the second in a series of international interdisciplinary conferences organised as part of the Flagship Project 'European Heritage in the Jagiellonian Library: Digital Authoring of the Berlin Collections. Core Facility (DiHeLib)', implemented within the framework of the strategic programme Excellence Initiative at the Jagiellonian University and coordinated by three units: the Faculty of Philology, the Jagiellonian Library, and the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy, and Applied Computer Science.  The latest issue of the prestigious Nature Communications journal features an article \"Systematic, computational discovery of multicomponent and one-pot reactions\", whose co-authors, working under the supervision of Prof. Bartosz Grzybowski, include Dr Sebastian Baś from the Department of Organic Chemistry at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Jagiellonian University.

The research will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from Charles University in Prague and Eberhard Charles University in Tübingen.  Researchers from the JU Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology together with colleagues from Durham University and the John Innes Centre have achieved a breakthrough in understanding DNA gyrase. This enzyme, present in bacteria but absent in humans, plays a crucial role in supercoiling DNA, a necessary process for bacterial survival. Using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, the researchers reveal unprecedented detail of gyrase’s action on DNA, potentially opening doors for new antibiotic therapies against resistant bacteria.  A miner’s work carries a lot of risk. The conditions inside the mine tunnels are hard, including high temperatures, humidity, and noise.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/studying-in-krakow", "text": "Kraków is one of the most prominent academic centres in Poland. With over 200,000 students coming to study here every year, it is not unreasonable to wonder what makes Kraków such an attractive place. While everyone certainly has their own individual reason, there are some which stand out amongst the others. Academic centre Ever since the Jagiellonian University was founded in 1364, Kraków has been known as a leading academic centre in Poland. Although there is a great number of respectable universities in our country, it is Kraków that immediately evokes images of student comradery and professors strolling through the streets of Old Town. This centuries-long academic tradition goes hand in hand with modern approach to education and state-of-the-art technology. For instance, Ruczaj, one of the districts located on the outskirts of Kraków, is rapidly transforming into a thriving centre of student activity thanks to the 3rd Campus of the Jagiellonian University. The fact that most higher education institutions in the city are sited near one another allows for a very close cooperation – not only scientific, but also related to culture and leisure. Booming job market Because Kraków's universities train highly qualified specialists in all kinds of fields, it is not at all surprising that businesses are very frequently set up in the region. International investors establish branches of their corporations in the area to ensure the influx of trained specialists. This offers prospective students a multitude of opportunities to develop careers in their desired professions. Perfect location Kraków's location is unique for several reasons. In addition to having all the benefits of a large city, including very well developed public transportation, easy access to hostels and student dormitories, and numerous shopping malls and restaurants, Kraków is also very close to the Tatra Mountains (with many ski resorts and trekking routes near Zakopane), beautiful national parks – Pieniny and Ojców, and Dunajec River Gorge, which offers some interesting rafting opportunities. Additionally, Kraków is not very far from other European capitals, such as Prague and Vienna, so weekend trips to neighbouring countries pose no problem to keen travellers. Kraków is also an important transport hub, with quick and comfortable bus, train and plane connections to other cities, both in Poland and abroad. City of kings Kraków is the historical capital of Poland, and as such, it is very deeply rooted in Polish tradition and culture. There is almost a tangible feel of history in the atmosphere of Kraków, while at the same time it is also very vivid and teeming with life. Galleries, museums, theatres, a philharmonic and an opera house – all these places offer unforgettable experiences to art aficionados. Small wonder that Kraków attracts thousands of tourists every year, regardless of season. The meeting place Despite its traditional nature, Kraków is not only about history. It is, first and foremost, a melting pot of diverse cultures, where people from all over the world meet to share their knowledge, experience, and friendship. Numerous clubs and pubs guarantee quality entertainment in a welcoming environment – be it in the open, spacious area of the Market Square, or mysterious, narrow alleyways of Kazimierz. Clubs are located close to one another, so hardened merrymakers may find themselves devoting entire evenings to exploring new places. Cultural, musical and film festivals, many of which are organised by students, also liven up the city. "}

Its aim is to come up with solutions that will enable the cultural tourism to develop without excessively disturbing the daily rhythm of life of residents. The project involves researchers from the JU Faculty of Management and Social Communication.  The winners of the 2024–25 STEM Impact Award programme have been announced by the Polish-American Fulbright Commission. One of them is Dr hab. Jan Boroński, Prof. UJ from the JU Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, who will carry out a research project at the City University of New York.  On 11 December, the oldest Polish university received a delegation from Una Europa – an alliance of 11 leading European universities that aims to establish a close-knit inter-university environment, which would make full use of the potential of its member institutions. One of the goals of the visit was to plan the next year's General Assembly, which will be organised on 26–28 May by the Jagiellonian University as one of the Una Europa founding members.  Prof. Tomasz Guzik from the Faculty of Medicine at the JU Medical College entered the prestigious list of world’s most cited researchers as the only scholar affiliated with a Polish institution. The JU scholar has been listed in the cross-field category. His academic output consists of 368 publications, including 56 cited more than 100 times. Altogether, his works have so far been cited 24.5 thousand times.  On 5 December 2024 at a special session of the Jagiellonian University Senate, the title of doctor honoris causa of the oldest Polish university was awarded to the Prof. Peter Kleinebudde. The German scientist was recognised for his outstanding achievements in research and its application, including implementation of innovative projects in the area of design and production of more effective medications.  The need for and methods of creating at Polish universities a comprehensive, welcoming, and attractive academic environment for international researchers and their families was the topic of the Internationalisation Day \"EURAXESS – Developing Institutional Potential for Welcoming International Researchers\", which took place on 17 December at the Jagiellonian University.  On 21-22 November, the Jagiellonian University hosted a conference entitled ;(Meta-) Data Orchestration: Connecting Manuscript Collections for Innovating Research – \"Berlinka\" in Action'. It was the second in a series of international interdisciplinary conferences organised as part of the Flagship Project 'European Heritage in the Jagiellonian Library: Digital Authoring of the Berlin Collections. Core Facility (DiHeLib)', implemented within the framework of the strategic programme Excellence Initiative at the Jagiellonian University and coordinated by three units: the Faculty of Philology, the Jagiellonian Library, and the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy, and Applied Computer Science.  The latest issue of the prestigious Nature Communications journal features an article \"Systematic, computational discovery of multicomponent and one-pot reactions\", whose co-authors, working under the supervision of Prof. Bartosz Grzybowski, include Dr Sebastian Baś from the Department of Organic Chemistry at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Jagiellonian University.  The journal Advances in Colloid and Interface Science has published a paper summarising the results of the research carried out by a team led by Dr hab. Janusz Dąbrowski, Prof. UJ from the JU Faculty of Chemistry. The paper is a comprehensive study of innovative compounds activated by near-infrared (NIR) photons, which are currently being introduced in diagnostics and cancer treatments.  The latest issue of Nature journal features the article ‘Digestive contents and food webs record the advent of dinosaur supremacy’ co-authored by Dr Artur Górecki and Dr Grzegorz Pacyna from the Institute of Botany at the Faculty of Biology of the Jagiellonian University. The discussed research sheds new light on the evolution and diversification of dinosaurs and the reasons why they dominated terrestrial ecosystems for almost 150 million years.  The trilateral project Enhanced-field spectroscopy on photoactive hybrid metal-semiconductor nanostructures received almost two million zlotys in funding within the framework of the OPUS 26+LAP/Weave call. The Polish group is led by Prof. Kamilla Małek from the JU Department of Chemical Physics. The research will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from Charles University in Prague and Eberhard Charles University in Tübingen.  Researchers from the JU Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology together with colleagues from Durham University and the John Innes Centre have achieved a breakthrough in understanding DNA gyrase. This enzyme, present in bacteria but absent in humans, plays a crucial role in supercoiling DNA, a necessary process for bacterial survival. Using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, the researchers reveal unprecedented detail of gyrase’s action on DNA, potentially opening doors for new antibiotic therapies against resistant bacteria.  A miner’s work carries a lot of risk. The conditions inside the mine tunnels are hard, including high temperatures, humidity, and noise. The miners also face a danger of explosion of the accumulated methane, which, consequently, needs to be removed from underground.

It has joined both the oldest European Coimbra Group network as well as the youngest European Universities Initiative within the framework of Una Europa alliance. The university has assisted the evolution of networks, especially over the last ten years. JU representatives have been also gradually joining or co-creating various networks evolving step by step in order to form deeper partnerships. As a result, those activities allow the university to implement more effectively principles of the University's strategy. Central coordination of JU participation in networks with a designated authority as well as administrative coordinator makes it easier to manage and harmonise all wide range of activities and thematic areas offered by the networks. It also helps finding and exploiting synergies between the networks.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/staff/staff-benefits/employee-capital-plans", "text": "What are the Employee Capital Plans (ECP)? Employee Capital Plans (ECP) are a voluntary and private long-term retirement saving system. How do the ECP work? The financial institution with which the employer sings agreements on operating and management of individual ECP accounts is chosen by the employer together with trade unions. Joint payments from the employer and employee are made to the account, along with the welcome payment and the annual benefit from the state. What are the Defined Date Funds? The Defined Date Fund is an investment fund within the framework of which the funds gathered in the Employee Capital Plans are invested. The particular sub-funds will follow different investment policies depending on the age of each participant. The older the employee, the safer financial instruments will be chosen to invest his or her funds. In practice, this means that the funds will be invested partly in shares and partly in debt (treasury bills, bonds, etc.). The percentage of funds invested in safer financial instruments will grow progressively along with the participant’s age. Is participation in the ECP obligatory? It is for the employer, but not for the employee. An employee is automatically enrolled in the programme, but he or she can leave it at any time, whereas an employer is obliged to participate, which means that when an employee is willing to participate, the employer’s share must be added to the employee’s account.  To whom are the ECP addressed? All employees no younger than 18 and no older than 55 are automatically enrolled in the programme. Employees between 55 and 70 years of age who want to join the ECP must submit a written declaration of their willingness to participate in the programme. Persons above the age of 70 cannot join the PPK (but those who were already participants of the ECP can continue their saving within its framework after reaching this age). How are contributions to the ECP made? An employee who joins the programme declares to make contributions of at least 2% of their gross salary, whereas an employer is mandated to contribute at least 1.5% of that gross salary. During the first year, the additional sum of 250 zlotys is transferred to the account (after at least 3 months of the employee’s participation), whereas the annual benefit from the state amounts to 240 zlotys. Can I increase or decrease the amount of my payments to the ECP? Yes, you can. The payment can be reduced to as little as 0.5% of gross salary if the employee’s monthly remuneration does not exceed 120% of the minimum monthly salary. The payment can also be increased by up to 2% of gross salary, which means that an employee can contribute from 2% to 4% of his or her gross salary (or, in special cases, from 0.5% to 4%).  What will be the monthly cost of my participation in the ECP? The basic cost is the declared percentage of gross monthly salary (default 2%) along with the income tax charged on the employer’s contribution (that is, on 1.5% of gross salary). Can I opt out from the programme? How can I do it? The ECP is a voluntary saving programme, so an employee can cancel his or her participation and leave the programme at any time. However, any employee who cancels participation in the ECP will be automatically enrolled in the programme every four years. If the person is still unwilling to make payments, he or she must submit another opt-out declaration. In the case of the University, which became subject to the Act on ECP of 1 January 2021, the first automatic re-enrolment of participants is  scheduled for the beginning of 2023, and will then be repeated every four years. When can I withdraw the money from the account? The ECP is a retirement saving programme, which assumes that all funds are withdrawn after the participant reaches the age of 60. The withdrawal process is divided into stages. 25% of the accumulated funds will be withdrawn at one time, and the remaining 75% - in monthly instalments during the following 10 years. This form of withdrawal after reaching the age of 60 will not entail any additional costs or taxation. An employee who, after receiving 25% of the accumulated funds, wishes to withdraw the remaining 75% in fewer instalments or all at once, will have to pay a tax charge. What if I would like to withdraw my money earlier? As participation in the ECP is not mandatory, the funds can be withdrawn at any moment, but this will entail additional charges. If the money is withdrawn before reaching the age of 60, the amount will be reduced by: The funds can be withdrawn without the deductions in exceptional situations, such as: What will happen to the accumulated funds if the participant dies before the age of 60? The funds accumulated in the ECP are fully inherited pursuant to the general rules of the Polish inheritance law. The beneficiaries can also be appointed by submitting the relevant decision to the investment fund. Will I be able to check the balance of my account? After joining the ECP, the investment fund will contact every participant providing him or her with the login and password to the system, enabling the participant to check the account balance, check how the funds are invested or, possibly, request changes in one’s personal data or investments. What if I have already been enrolled in the ECP by my previous employer? If a new employee was or is the ECP participant as part of another employment, he or she may transfer the previously accumulated funds to one specific investment fund of the selected employer or leave the money at two different investment funds and continue gathering them in two different accounts.

Hiring an academic teacher on more than a half-time basis (both for specified and unspecified period) is determined by a request for tenders. An academic teacher eligible for retirement may be re-hired at the same position without a request for tenders.  A request for tenders does not apply if the teacher is hired for a specified period of time and:  A non-academic employee may be hired for a trial period, specified or unspecified period of time, or on the basis of a replacement contract. The employees' duties are determined by their superiors.  There are two conditions which need to be fulfilled by both academic and non-academic employee to be hired:  Employees are obligated to periodically undergo Personal Capability Assessments. Should an employee be unable to work for more than 30 days, they must also undergo additional assessments to determine whether they are is still fit to work at their position. The employer may not allow an employee to work without a positive opinion from a doctor.  Foreigners are  hired according to the same regulations as Polish citizens; however they must meet additional requirements related to hiring employees from the inside and outside of the European Union – i.e. a valid residence card or a work visa.  The above mentioned rules apply regardless of the type of contract.  An employment relationship with a foreigner from outside of the European Union lasts until the expiration date of work visa or residence card. To extend the duration of the relationship, the validity period of a proper document must first be extended.  Foreigners hired on the basis of an employment contract or a contract of specific work are automatically charged for health and social insurance.  Foreigners possessing the A1 form are eligible for health and social insurance, but are not charged for it (provided they have a health insurance and a social insurance in their country of permanent residence).  An employee is entitled to a salary based on completed work. For non-working periods, the employees retain their right to a full salary only in following situations:  The benefits of the employee include:  An employee hired on the basis of an appointment or an employment contract is automatically charged for health and social insurance.  Employee have a right to apply for health insurance for their unemployed spouse and children below the age of 18 (26 for children in education).  Employees working on the basis of a contract of mandate without any other insurance entitlement, are automatically charged for pension, retirement pension, accident and health insurance for the period stated in the contract. Sickness insurance is not obligatory.  Insurance application at the Social Security Institution is submitted via contractor's declaration attached to the contract.  Contractor possessing a pension and retirement pension insurance due to a contract of mandate may apply for a health insurance for their family members.  Contracts of specific work with outsourced personnel are not submitted to the Social Security Institution.  In the event of concurrence of insurance entitlements in several EU countries, employees leaving to work abroad receive the A1 form from the Office of Human Resources. The form must then be approved by the Social Security Institution and submitted to the foreign employer. Based on this form, the proper institution in the country will return the insurance premiums for the period stated in the document. This also applies to foreigners from the EU countries hired at the JU.

Serdecznie zapraszamy na spotkanie z przedstawicielami marki Bio-Techne W ostatnich latach spektroskopia IR zyskała na znaczeniu szczególnie w branży farmaceutycznej. Rola tej techniki sprowadza się m.in. do rutynowej oceny jakości i czystości surowców czy też  potwierdzenia tożsamości substancji czynnych oraz pomocniczych w wyrobach medycznych. Wysokosprawna chromatografia cieczowa (HPLC) to technika analityczna, która może być wykorzystywana do badania czystości oraz identyfikacji związków chemicznych, a w wersji preparatywnej może służyć do oczyszczania substancji z mieszanin. Jest nam niezmiernie miło poinformować, że w tym roku Jagiellońskie Centrum Innowacji zostało jednym ze sponsorów Pierwszej Ogólnopolskiej Konferencji dla specjalistów z branży badań klinicznych wyrobów medycznych (sprzętu medycznego) i badań działania wyrobów do diagnostyki in vitro (testów oraz medycznych urządzeń analitycznych), która odbędzie się już 20 kwietnia w Warszawie. Badanie fotostabilności jest wymagane w przemyśle farmaceutycznym zarówno dla określenia wrażliwości substancji aktywnych stosowanych w preparatach farmaceutycznych jak również gotowych postaci leków. Badania fotostabilności zalecane są również w przemyśle kosmetycznym. Ludzki mikrobiom odgrywa bardzo ważną rolę dla zachowania zdrowia.

The exchange comprises summer schools, short research stays and regular studies. The Jagiellonian University also participates in the international exchange within the framework of SYLFF - The Ryoichi Sasakawa Young Leaders Fellowship Fund, aimed at supporting especially talented graduate and doctoral students with high leadership skills, specialising in social sciences, humanities, law, economy and management. The Jagiellonian University's participation in the programme is also coordinated by the International Relations Office. The JU website of SYLFF is available here. The goal of the Careers Service is to offer JU students and alumni assistance and support in an effective job search and career development by: Disability Support Service is committed to equality of opportunity for students with diabilities, regardless of how serious or extensive they are. We embrace the constitutional law guaranteeing persons with disabilities education, work and participation in social affairs, which, we believe, is ethically commendable and economically justified. In our mission we have been guided by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities of 2006, which Poland signed in March 2007. We support all initiatives which aim at putting the UN guidelines into practice and the efforts to pass the anti-discrimination law in Poland. In our philosophy and work we try to follow the ideas of tolerance and open-mindedness first spread in Poland by the royal Jagiellonian dynasty in the 14th-16th centuries. Student Centre for Support and Adaptation \"SOWA\" is a project of the Jagiellonian University and the University Hospital in Kraków addressed to Jagiellonian University students. In the centre you can talk to a qualified person about mental health problems affecting your studies, work or private life. You can also participate in thematic support groups. The offer is addressed not only to Polish, but also English-speaking students. Apart from experiencing challenges faced by the majority of young people starting their studies at universities (moving out of the family home, shaping their own identity, adapting to the role of a student, learning efficient time management), foreign students struggle additionally with culture shock, related to language barriers, homesickness, loneliness, and social differences. Participation in an adjustment support group will help you in preventing negative effects of the adjustment period and will give you tools to effectively deal with personal and academic issues in a foreign country. The role of the JU E-learning is to promote academic e-learning, to support new teaching methods and strategies and to offer assitance to university teachers in developing Internet-based classes and running them.

The aim of the Fund is to aid scholars and PhD students from Central-Eastern Europe, former Soviet Union and the Balkan area, who plan to conduct their research in Kraków. The original creators of the Fund hope that this initiative will lead to closer ties between scholars from this part of Europe. The Fund’s aim is to support international students and high school graduates who cannot continue education in their home countries – due to the political situation there – and want to enrol in a programme of study conducted in Polish at the Jagiellonian University. It was instituted by the Rector’s governance together with the JU Senate to commemorate the scholarship’s Patron. Professor Franciszek Ziejka (1940-2020) was the JU’s honorary professor and former Rector of our university.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/about-university/history", "text": "The Kraków University is the oldest higher education institution in Poland and one of the oldest in Europe. It was founded on 12 May 1364 by the Polish king Casimir the Great. The Studium Generale – as the University was then called – comprised three faculties: of liberal arts, medicine and law. Only the former two were active during the founder's life. After the king's death, the University ceased to exist. Following the failed attempts to restore it in the 1390s, the University was re-founded by King Vladislaus Jagiełło on 26 July 1400. Queen Jadwiga, who died in 1399, contributed to the restoration by leaving a considerable portion of her private estate to the University in her last will. The University's structure was already complete in 1397, with the formal establishment of the faculty of theology. The oldest, main college was at first called the Royal Jagiellonian College (Collegium Regium), and then the Greater College (Collegium Maius). The University, located in the then capital of the Kingdom of Poland, never again interrupted its educational and scholarly activity. Not only does it constitute a symbol of continuity of the Polish state, but also places Kraków among the most important educational centres in the country. During the 15th century, the University flourished. It attracted learners from all of Europe – every year, some 200 new students enroled. Aside from Poles, the University was also attended by Ruthenians, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Germans, Czechs, the Swiss, the English, the Dutch, the French, the Spanish, Italians, and even Tartars. It was known for providing education in the fields of law, mathematics and astronomy. Among the professors of this age there were two brilliant lawyers – Stanisław of Skarbimierz and Paweł Włodkowic (Paulus Vladimiri) – as well as great mathematicians, astronomers and geographers: Marcin Król of Żurawica, Jan of Głogów, Wojciech of Brudzewo, Maciej of Miechów. The world famous astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus enroled as a student in 1491. The second half of the 16th century brought crisis. The Reformation and religious division of Europe combined with the creation of many new universities led to a decrease in the influx of foreign students. In Poland admission to important offices was restricted to nobility without a higher education prerequisite, which caused the University to acquire a bourgeois character. In this area, it competed with the new universities in Vilnius and Zamość as well as Jesuit schools. In spite of that, later Polish statesmen, bishops and writers, such as Mikołaj Rej, Jan Kochanowski, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski, Stanisław Hozjusz and Marcin Kromer studied in this period at the University, which as of late 16th century became known as Kraków Academy. The 17th century was dominated by the struggle between the Academy and the Jesuits, who desired to seize control of education in Kraków. During that time, the Academy also created a highly developed school system dependent on it (known as the \"academic colonies\"). Among the scholars of that century, one particularly worth mentioning is the mathematician Jan Brożek. As far as notable students are concerned, John Sobieski, later king of Poland and victor of the 1683 Relief of Vienna, graduated from the Academy in that period. The establishment of the Commission for National Education in 1773 ushered in a new epoch in the history of the Kraków University. The Commission was the first state body the chief aim of which was the reconstruction of the educational system in Poland. Hugo Kołłątaj was appointed as the reform's executor. He restructured the University during the years 1777–1786. He replaced the four original faculties with two colleges: the Collegium Morale (theology, law and literature) and the Collegium Physicum (mathematics, physics and medicine). He introduced lectures in Polish (with the exception of theology), brought in distinguished scholars (including mathematician and astronomer Jan Śniadecki), furthered the development of natural and exact sciences, and initiated the construction of the astronomical observatory, the botanical garden and the university clinic. During the time of the reform, the University changed its name to the Principal School of the Realm. In the following years, the historic circumstances caused the University to change its name yet again – to the Principal School of Kraków. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), Kraków was incorporated into Austria. In 1805, it was joined with Lviv University and Germanised. Re-Polonisation followed in 1809, when Kraków was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Kraków attained the status of an independent state as the Free City of Kraków, in which the university professors gained a considerable political influence. Poles from Austria, Russia and Prussia were welcome to enrol at the University, but the governments of these states hampered the efforts of prospective students. In 1817, the University acquired its modern name: the Jagiellonian University. Following the dissolution of the Free City and the incorporation of Kraków into Austria (1846), the University was reorganised according to the Austrian model and German again became the language of tuition. In the second half of the 19th century, when Austria granted the Poles in Galicia an actual autonomy, crucial changes in the University's situation led to a substantial growth of its scholarly and social significance. Polish was reinstated as the language of tuition. A new main college was erected (Collegium Novum, 1887). There was a rapid development in both sciences and humanities. Several scholars distinguished themselves in diverse academic fields: Józef Szujski and Michał Bobrzyński (known as the creators of the Kraków school of history) in historiography, Stanisław Tarnowski in history of literature, Jan Baudouin de Courtenay in linguistics, Karol Olszewski in chemistry, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Marian Smoluchowski in physics. Students came from the Polish lands of all three partitions and from the Habsburg Monarchy. Apart from Poles, the University attracted Ruthenians, Ukrainians and Belarusians, Czechs, Moravians and other Slavs as well as Jews and Germans – approximately one thousand new students a year. Among them were Bronisław Malinowski, later anthropologist and author of international renown, and Ivo Andrić, later Nobel Laureate in Literature. After Poland regained its independence in 1918 the development of the Jagiellonian University continued. Over 4 thousand young men and women attended the University. Its importance in that time is evidenced by the names of brilliant philologists (Ignacy Chrzanowski, Kazimierz Nitsch, Tadeusz Sinko), historians (Roman Grodecki, Władysław Konopczyński), archaeologists (Tadeusz Sulimirski), lawyers (Rafał Taubenschlag, Fryderyk Zoll), mathematicians (Stanisław Zaremba, Tadeusz Banachiewicz, Kazimierz Żorawski), chemists (Leon Sternbach Jr., Leon Marchlewski), among others. A Faculty of Agriculture was established (1923), and the Jagiellonian Library was erected (1939). During the Second World War, on 6th November 1939, Nazi German authorities deceived nearly 180 scholars and staff members of the Jagiellonian University into gathering in Collegium Novum, then brutally arrested and deported them to concentration camps, where several of them have met their death. Another group of scholars, captured as military officers by the Soviets (who invaded Poland on 17 September 1939), was executed by the order of Joseph Stalin in Katyn (1940). The Nazi Germans closed the University. As a result, clandestine education commenced in 1942 for approximately 800 students. One of them was Karol Wojtyła, who later became pope John Paul II. In 1945, over 5000 students enrolled to the University. Among them was Wisława Szymborska, later poet and Nobel Laureate. It became a safe haven for scholars who had been forced to leave Lviv and Vilnius due to the change of eastern Polish borders as well as those who could not return to Warsaw because of its destruction by Nazi Germans. In the new, communist political reality, the University's structure was subject to many changes. Theological, agricultural and medical faculties were removed. In 1948 the worst period in the post-war history of the Jagiellonian University began – the era of Stalinism. Communist officials prevented some of the well-known scholars from conducting their research, including the philosopher Roman Ingarden, historian Władysław Konopczyński and economist Adam Krzyżanowski. In the following decades political turbulence impacted the history of the Jagiellonian University. The years 1968 and 1981 witnessed waves of student demonstrations against the regime. Regardless of this, the Jagiellonian University remained an institution where distinguished scholars continued their work in the academic fields of Polish studies (Juliusz Kleiner, Stanisław Pigoń, Kazimierz Wyka), history (Jan Dąbrowski, Henryk Wereszycki), botany (Henryk Niewodniczański), psychology (Stefan Szuman), legal history (Adam Vetulani), law (Ludwik Ehrlich), linguistics (Jerzy Kuryłowicz), astronomy (Kazimierz Kordylewski), molecular biology (Jan Zurzycki), and mathematics (Tadeusz Ważewski, Franciszek Leja, Stanisław Gołąb, Jacek Szarski). Currently the Jagiellonian University comprises fifteen faculties, including three medical ones, which were reincorporated into the University in 1993 and now form the Medical College. A new Campus of the 600th Anniversary of the Jagiellonian University Revival is under construction. Approximately 50 thousand students attend the university each year; 65% of them are women. Aside from students from the European Union, the University is also attended by visitors from Africa and Asia as well as new states of the Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Belarus). Today the University employs 3.8 thousand academic staff, including over 650 professors, as well as about 3.5 thousand other staff members, while providing education to about 40 thousand students. Therefore, the impression that an institution like ours creates must properly reflect its presence in the social life of Poland, its timelessness and unwavering symbolism. Because of this, large scale investments are being financed, such as: the continued expansion of the Campus of the 600th Anniversary of the Jagiellonian University Revival, where the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science has recently been relocated, the construction of new quarters for the Faculty of Chemistry, the continued construction of the Centre for Natural Sciences Education and the Institute of Geology, restoration and expansion of Collegium Paderevianum for the Faculty of Philology and the thorough renovation of Collegium Novum and the streets of the \"university quarter\". We constantly improve and expand our infrastructure to create an ever better environment for scholarly research, teaching and learning. Funds for the abovementioned investments are acquired from various sources, e.g. the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the European Union, the Municipality of Kraków, the Civic Committe for the Restoration of Kraków Heritage Sites as well as the University itself.

The motto Plus ratio quam vis (Latin: Reason before force) is inscribed on the portal leading from the Assembly Hall do the Copernicus Room in Collegium Maius.

The maxim, included in the JU Statute, expresses the idea that has guided the oldest Polish higher education institution throughout its existence. It also reflects the moral bearing of the University in the face of historical challenges. The medal was also presented to numerous distinguished personalities, including Dr James Dewey Watson – Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology (for \"discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\"), Aníbal Cavaco Silva – economist and politician, former prime minister and current president of Portugal, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing – politician, former president of France as well as eminent scholars, such as Prof. Andrzej Zoll, Prof. Władysław Stróżewski and Prof. Adam Bielański, and former rectors of the University, including Prof. Andrzej Pelczar, Prof. Franciszek Ziejka and Prof. Karol Musioł. 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Prof. Yukihiro Ozaki 2013   2012   2011    2010   2009   2008   2007   2006   2005   1997 "}

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/about-university/ju-awards/oswiecim", "text": " The Oświęcim Award for Human Rights of John Paul II was established to pay tribute to the Pope's role as a great advocate of human rights as a basis for the \"civilization of love and solidarity\". It aims to promote the values which are universal in the modern-day world, such as the unalienable dignity of every human being, truth, good and beauty. The words of the Auschwitz martyr, Saint Maximilian Kolbe that \"only love is creative\" are the motto of the Award.    The name \"Oświęcim\" (the Polish town where the German concentration camp Auschwitz was located) and the words of St. Maximilian as a motto are a clear reference to the reality of Auschwitz: a place of planned annihilation of human and humanity, one of the supreme symbols of 20th century totalitarianisms. At the same time, Auschwitz shows that human dignity is inalienable and impossible to destroy by any system and by any hatred. This human dignity, rooted in the spiritual nature of human being is the source of what we call human rights. The memory of the tragedy of Auschwitz cannot be thus directed solely towards the past. On the contrary, it serves as an ever-relevant \"examination of the conscience of mankind\".  The Award serves as a means to creatively develop the Oświęcim legacy of John Paul II. It aims at reviving the reflection upon the idea of human rights. This is also important because of the tendency to distort this idea, which may lead to the instrumental treatment of human beings and their subordination to the political and economic goals, the phenomenon especially strongly present in the modern western civilization within the area of legislation. Hence, it is important not to use human rights as a means of imposing the will of the minority and an instrument of social engineering. On the other hand, each human right is, in practice, limited by other human rights, which makes social compromise necessary and encourages people who think differently to meet and talk. Yet, this always has to be a meeting of truth and respect, a meeting oriented towards values. From this historic, ethical, and anthropological perspective the real goal of the Award emerges: to pay tribute to the people whose life and activity have proved that this is the real sense of human rights.   The contest is organized by the Board of Trustees of the Oświęcim Award for Human Rights of John Paul II.

He is an ardent proponent of the attitude of commitment, both in thinking and in politics. He belongs to the generation of French intellectuals, who rebelled against the dominant Marxism in the 1970s. His philosophical views have been based on deep moral sensitivity to harm and suffering. He tries to communicate this sort of sensitivity to his readers, encouraging them to reflect upon human suffering inflicted by other human beings. This sensitivity makes him horrified by the cruelty, present throughout the history on nearly all fields of human activity. For many years he has been preaching his \"eleventh commandment\": Thou shall not make other people suffer and pursue your goals at their expense, but refrain from evil.   "}

The first draft of the document, was prepared by a team led by Prof. Jarosław Górniak, JU Vice-Rector for University Development, in collaboration with other vice-rectors, chancellors and bursars. The preliminary version gained the approval of the Rector’s Committee on 14 April 2021 and was subsequently debated on by the Jagiellonian University academic community, culminating in an open online discussion on 10 May 2021. On 25 May, the Strategy was approved by the University Council, and a month later, on 26 June, its final version was voted on by the JU Senate as part of the resolution No. 71/VI/2021.  Sustainable development, nature conservation and climate change mitigation are the most urgent challenges of the 21st century. "}
{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/about-university/projects-and-investments/durable", "text": " Outbreaks of infectious diseases are increasing due to multiple local and global interaction changes disrupting the fragile balance of the complex human-animal-environment ecosystem. The increased frequency and complexity of health threats require a different, unified form of preparedness and a coordinated, fast, reliable and effective emergency response.  DURABLE is a tailored solution to this recognised need - a strong network of world-class basic and translational research institutes and public health centres across Europe with an outstanding track record in public health support with global reach. DURABLE aims to provide high-quality scientific information in record time to support HERA’s decision-making in preparing for and responding to cross-border health threats and assessing the impact of countermeasures. DURABLE will coordinate a global collaboration, from pathogen detection, evolutionary analysis and threat characterisation, with One Health approach, to data and information collection and sharing, for optimal threat response. DURABLE is a unique multidisciplinary consortium with complementary expertise to meet this challenge and build productive interactions with HERA and other stakeholders. Due to their outstanding track record and experience in the field, the DURABLE consortium is competent from day one. DURABLE will develop and validate a roadmap for rapid deployment of key countermeasures, test the robustness of the network, and assess key aspects of its emergency mode when simula­ting or dealing with identified threats. Additionally, DURABLE will focus on long-term sustainability by focusing on capacity building, training the next generation of researchers and developing pandemic preparedness training modules for the network and beyond. WP1 will develop a joint consortium communication strategy and tools, and a data management plan. WP2 will deliver a comprehensive model of the lab network structure, a governance and sustainability plan, a stakeholder analysis and KPIs and scenario exercises. WP3 will map the core network, the links with research consortia and other initiatives, and the extended international network of the individual partners and possible future initiatives. WP4 will develop a toolbox facilitating the broader surveillance, and prepositioned sampling protocols. WP5 will develop new state-of-the-art in vitro and ex-vivo laboratory systems to study virus infections, and new assays to determine phenotypic traits. WP6 will develop assays and run screening campaigns with 250,000 compounds to identify hits (Hits that block replication are interesting as tool compounds supporting mechanistic studies). WP7 will develop and provide a new database, and a new generation of analytical tools for pathogen and outbreak tracking. WP8 will develop new mathematical models and a comprehensive analytical framework supporting risk assessments. WP9 will facilitate the rapid roll out of essential assays in case of new discoveries through WP4 or from outside of the consortium. WP10 will deliver three Project Schools, webinars and comprehensive training materials. WP11 will develop a protocol for a coordinated response to emergencies. 1.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/about-university/faculties-and-other-units/hotels/rabka", "text": "The text is based on an article by Dr Edyta Gawron published in issue 231/232 of Alma Mater journal (March-April 2022) – the link is available below. Stasin and Niemen villas in the town of Rabka, currently used as staff guesthouses of the Jagiellonian University, were among three buildings that from June to August 1945 housed a Jewish children’s home, also known as a care and treatment centre. Each of the buildings accommodated at least several dozen boys and girls saved from the Holocaust. On 28 August 1945 the centre was closed down due to repeated antisemitic attacks posing danger the occupants’ lives. The children were evacuated to other care institutions. Jews were among the patients coming to Rabka health resort from its very beginning. One of the most visible groups of visitors were children, whose needs were catered for by specially created and adapted hotels and guesthouses. The greatest contribution to the popularity of Rabka health resort among Jews was made by summer camps for Jewish children, organised by the Association for Curative Summer Camps in Rabka, based in Kraków. Initiated by Kraków teacher Salomon Spitzer, they took place regularly from 1890 to the outbreak of the Second World War. Initially, children participating in the summer camps were accommodated in private lodgings, until 1907, when a dedicated building, funded by Maria and Wilhelm Frankl, started to be used. In the years to follow, it was successively remodelled and better adapted  to the needs of young patients. Besides the health resort visitors, Rabka also had its own local Jewish community. In the interwar period (1918–1939) it grew from over one hundred to about 450 people, which, combined with the temporary presence of and support from many more Jews visiting the resort, was enough to sustain basic Jewish institutions, such as a synagogue, a matzah bakery, a bathhouse, and a refuge for the poor and elderly. Regrettably, Jews in Rabka were affected by antisemitic sentiments that intensified in the 1930s, with some voices criticising the very presence of Jews in the health resort and the local press calling for economic struggle against them. The history of the Jewish Community in Rabka was brought to an abrupt end by the Second World War and the Holocaust, in which millions European Jews, including about 90 percent of Polish Jews, perished at the hands of Nazi Germans and their collaborators. In January and February 1945, which marked the end of military operations in the Małopolska region, the Jewish survivors started to emerge from hiding. They included orphaned children in need of care. One of the first places to accommodate them was the building of the Provincial Jewish Committee in Kraków at ul. Długa 38. Because of the health condition of most of the survived children, a need arose to create a proper care and treatment centre for the young patients, and a relevant plan based on pre-war experiences was prepared. Rabka was chosen as a natural location of such an institution, due to its pre-war status of a health resort popular with Kraków Jewry. Yet, the establishment of a Jewish orphanage in this town was by no means an easy task, both because of the lack of vacant buildings and an unfriendly attitude from local authorities and some local residents. Finally, the children’s home in Rabka, aimed to accommodate most severely ill young patients, was opened at the turn of June and July 1945. It consisted of three buildings – Stasin, Juras and Niemen villas, which provided quarters for one hundred children, mainly from Kraków, Warsaw, and Łódź. Unfortunately, during the very first weeks of their stay in Rabka, the children became target of attacks, which included throwing of a grenade into the Niemen villa one day after the Kraków pogrom of 11 August 1945. Fortunately, no one was hurt. The documents, found by Karolina Panz, who conduted research into the post-war history of Jews in the Podhale region, indicate that the assault was organised by students and teachers of Jan Wieczorkowski’s secondary school for men. The researcher claims that the threatening letters were allegedly authored by Rev. Józef Hojoł and anonymously delivered to the orphanage authorities by Mieczysław Klempka, known as ‘Kot’ (cat) – a leader of underground scout movement in the above-mentioned school. The messages contained threats of repression if the children do not leave Rabka. The second attack on the orphanage took place on 19 August 1945, when all three buildings were hit with machine gun fire and grenades. Another incident happened on 27 August. Again, there were no casualties. For unclear reasons, members of local police and state security service did not intervene. The officers from the town of Nowy Targ delegated to protect the children were also absent from the crime scene. On 28 August 1945, a decision to close down the Jewish orphanage in Rabka was made. The children who had parents or guardians were returned to them. Some orphans were relocated to children’s homes in Otwock and Bielsko. Those most badly ill and without any chances for receiving care from relatives were taken to an orphanage in Zakopane. The fear of further attacks turned out to be well founded, since at night on 28–29 August 1945 the Zakopane orphanage was fired at with machine guns. Fortunately, like during previous incidents, no one was injured, but in the following weeks the institution was subject to verbal attacks and written threats. As local security services refused to protect the children, the institution was closed down in mid-March 1946. The orphanage director decided that the children should be moved abroad.  On 18 March 1946 most children, accompanied by the staff and several soldiers, boarded a lorry, crossed the state border in Cieszyn and entered Czechoslovakia, from where they went to France. The children who stayed in Zakopane – 22 half-orphans or those under guardians’ care – went to Kraków together with one staff member. So ends the short and dramatic history of post-World War II Jewish children’s homes in Podhale.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/about-university/overview", "text": " The Jagiellonian University is the oldest higher education institution in Poland and one of the oldest in Europe. It was founded on 12 May 1364 by the Polish king Casimir the Great. The Jubilee year 2014 marked the 650th anniversary of this remarkable event.  Since its very beginning, the Jagiellonian University has been an international institution. Poles, Ruthenians, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Germans, Czechs, the Swiss, the English, the Dutch, the French the Spanish, Italians, and even Tatars studied here in the old days. Further development of the University has been inextricably bound with the turbulent and often tragic history of Poland. The institution managed to survive both the partitions of Poland by Russia, Prussia and Austria, and the two world wars, serving as a guardian of Polish culture and identity and educating successive generations of Poles, as well as members of other nations, significantly contributing to the intellectual heritage of Europe. Some of the Jagiellonian University students and academics have been major historical figures, including world famous scholars, such as Nicolaus Copernicus or Karol Olszewski, as well as Karol Wojtyła, the future Pope John Paul II. Today, the Jagiellonian University comprises 16 Faculties, where nearly 4 thousand academic staff conduct research and provide education to almost 40 thousand students, within the framework of more than 150 different fields of study. Eminent researchers and state-of-the-art infrastructure make the JU one of the leading Polish scientific institutions, collaborating with major academic centres from all over the world. The Jagiellonian University is also home to numerous student research societies, where young researchers pursue their academic interests and develop friendships with people who share their passion. The university's prestige in both Poland and abroad is illustrated by its widely recognised research achievements. The scientists and physicians from the JU Medical College carry out pioneer studies, e.g. in cardiac surgery, urology and neurology, often leading to the development of novel treatment methods. Their findings have been published in some of the most prestigious international journals, for instance European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, and Lancet. JU archaeologists explore the secrets of ancient sites in various parts of the world, including Egypt, Cyprus, Central America, South Asia and Altay. The astronomers take part in the most important international projects in their field, including H.E.S.S. and VIPERS, whereas the results of research by JU biotechnologists have been published in such reputable specialist journals as Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, Molecular Ecology Resources or European Journal of Human Genetics. These are only some examples of remarkable successes for which the Jagiellonian University has been famous in recent years. The most unique large-scale projects run by the Jagiellonian University include the Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics, Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology, OMICRON, and National Synchrotron Radiation Centre SOLARIS. Yet another advantage of the Jagiellonian University is its location in the historic city of Kraków, the former capital of Poland and a great cultural centre, visited by millions of tourists. Some of the University buildings are major historical sites themselves.

Its aim is to come up with solutions that will enable the cultural tourism to develop without excessively disturbing the daily rhythm of life of residents. The project involves researchers from the JU Faculty of Management and Social Communication.  The winners of the 2024–25 STEM Impact Award programme have been announced by the Polish-American Fulbright Commission. One of them is Dr hab. Jan Boroński, Prof. UJ from the JU Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, who will carry out a research project at the City University of New York.  On 11 December, the oldest Polish university received a delegation from Una Europa – an alliance of 11 leading European universities that aims to establish a close-knit inter-university environment, which would make full use of the potential of its member institutions. One of the goals of the visit was to plan the next year's General Assembly, which will be organised on 26–28 May by the Jagiellonian University as one of the Una Europa founding members.  Prof. Tomasz Guzik from the Faculty of Medicine at the JU Medical College entered the prestigious list of world’s most cited researchers as the only scholar affiliated with a Polish institution. The JU scholar has been listed in the cross-field category. His academic output consists of 368 publications, including 56 cited more than 100 times. Altogether, his works have so far been cited 24.5 thousand times.  On 5 December 2024 at a special session of the Jagiellonian University Senate, the title of doctor honoris causa of the oldest Polish university was awarded to the Prof. Peter Kleinebudde. The German scientist was recognised for his outstanding achievements in research and its application, including implementation of innovative projects in the area of design and production of more effective medications.  The need for and methods of creating at Polish universities a comprehensive, welcoming, and attractive academic environment for international researchers and their families was the topic of the Internationalisation Day \"EURAXESS – Developing Institutional Potential for Welcoming International Researchers\", which took place on 17 December at the Jagiellonian University.  On 21-22 November, the Jagiellonian University hosted a conference entitled ;(Meta-) Data Orchestration: Connecting Manuscript Collections for Innovating Research – \"Berlinka\" in Action'. It was the second in a series of international interdisciplinary conferences organised as part of the Flagship Project 'European Heritage in the Jagiellonian Library: Digital Authoring of the Berlin Collections. Core Facility (DiHeLib)', implemented within the framework of the strategic programme Excellence Initiative at the Jagiellonian University and coordinated by three units: the Faculty of Philology, the Jagiellonian Library, and the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy, and Applied Computer Science.  The latest issue of the prestigious Nature Communications journal features an article \"Systematic, computational discovery of multicomponent and one-pot reactions\", whose co-authors, working under the supervision of Prof. Bartosz Grzybowski, include Dr Sebastian Baś from the Department of Organic Chemistry at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Jagiellonian University.  The journal Advances in Colloid and Interface Science has published a paper summarising the results of the research carried out by a team led by Dr hab. Janusz Dąbrowski, Prof. UJ from the JU Faculty of Chemistry. The paper is a comprehensive study of innovative compounds activated by near-infrared (NIR) photons, which are currently being introduced in diagnostics and cancer treatments.  The latest issue of Nature journal features the article ‘Digestive contents and food webs record the advent of dinosaur supremacy’ co-authored by Dr Artur Górecki and Dr Grzegorz Pacyna from the Institute of Botany at the Faculty of Biology of the Jagiellonian University. The discussed research sheds new light on the evolution and diversification of dinosaurs and the reasons why they dominated terrestrial ecosystems for almost 150 million years.  The trilateral project Enhanced-field spectroscopy on photoactive hybrid metal-semiconductor nanostructures received almost two million zlotys in funding within the framework of the OPUS 26+LAP/Weave call. The Polish group is led by Prof. Kamilla Małek from the JU Department of Chemical Physics. The research will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from Charles University in Prague and Eberhard Charles University in Tübingen.  Researchers from the JU Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology together with colleagues from Durham University and the John Innes Centre have achieved a breakthrough in understanding DNA gyrase. This enzyme, present in bacteria but absent in humans, plays a crucial role in supercoiling DNA, a necessary process for bacterial survival. Using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, the researchers reveal unprecedented detail of gyrase’s action on DNA, potentially opening doors for new antibiotic therapies against resistant bacteria.  A miner’s work carries a lot of risk. The conditions inside the mine tunnels are hard, including high temperatures, humidity, and noise. The miners also face a danger of explosion of the accumulated methane, which, consequently, needs to be removed from underground. Despite many modern safety measures, the release of methane remains one of the key problems of mining industry, especially in the face of the planned EU directive effectively banning the emission of this gas to the atmosphere. Does this mean the end of methane emitting mines in Poland?  Can you present the essence of your research in just three minutes?

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_US/staff/employment", "text": " An employment relationship between an academic teacher and the Jagiellonian University is established either by appointment (exclusive for holders of the title of professor) or an employment contract.  Hiring an academic teacher on more than a half-time basis (both for specified and unspecified period) is determined by a request for tenders. An academic teacher eligible for retirement may be re-hired at the same position without a request for tenders.  A request for tenders does not apply if the teacher is hired for a specified period of time and:  A non-academic employee may be hired for a trial period, specified or unspecified period of time, or on the basis of a replacement contract. The employees' duties are determined by their superiors.  There are two conditions which need to be fulfilled by both academic and non-academic employee to be hired:  Employees are obligated to periodically undergo Personal Capability Assessments. Should an employee be unable to work for more than 30 days, they must also undergo additional assessments to determine whether they are is still fit to work at their position. The employer may not allow an employee to work without a positive opinion from a doctor.  Foreigners are  hired according to the same regulations as Polish citizens; however they must meet additional requirements related to hiring employees from the inside and outside of the European Union – i.e. a valid residence card or a work visa.  The above mentioned rules apply regardless of the type of contract.  An employment relationship with a foreigner from outside of the European Union lasts until the expiration date of work visa or residence card. To extend the duration of the relationship, the validity period of a proper document must first be extended.  Foreigners hired on the basis of an employment contract or a contract of specific work are automatically charged for health and social insurance.  Foreigners possessing the A1 form are eligible for health and social insurance, but are not charged for it (provided they have a health insurance and a social insurance in their country of permanent residence).  An employee is entitled to a salary based on completed work. For non-working periods, the employees retain their right to a full salary only in following situations:  The benefits of the employee include:  An employee hired on the basis of an appointment or an employment contract is automatically charged for health and social insurance.

Contractor possessing a pension and retirement pension insurance due to a contract of mandate may apply for a health insurance for their family members.  Contracts of specific work with outsourced personnel are not submitted to the Social Security Institution.  In the event of concurrence of insurance entitlements in several EU countries, employees leaving to work abroad receive the A1 form from the Office of Human Resources. The form must then be approved by the Social Security Institution and submitted to the foreign employer. Based on this form, the proper institution in the country will return the insurance premiums for the period stated in the document. This also applies to foreigners from the EU countries hired at the JU.  After meeting the requirements enumerated in the Higher Education Act, the Labour Code and special regulations, both academic and non-academic staff are entitled to leaves.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_US/staff/staff-benefits/employee-capital-plans", "text": "What are the Employee Capital Plans (ECP)? Employee Capital Plans (ECP) are a voluntary and private long-term retirement saving system. How do the ECP work? The financial institution with which the employer sings agreements on operating and management of individual ECP accounts is chosen by the employer together with trade unions. Joint payments from the employer and employee are made to the account, along with the welcome payment and the annual benefit from the state. What are the Defined Date Funds? The Defined Date Fund is an investment fund within the framework of which the funds gathered in the Employee Capital Plans are invested. The particular sub-funds will follow different investment policies depending on the age of each participant. The older the employee, the safer financial instruments will be chosen to invest his or her funds. In practice, this means that the funds will be invested partly in shares and partly in debt (treasury bills, bonds, etc.). The percentage of funds invested in safer financial instruments will grow progressively along with the participant’s age. Is participation in the ECP obligatory? It is for the employer, but not for the employee. An employee is automatically enrolled in the programme, but he or she can leave it at any time, whereas an employer is obliged to participate, which means that when an employee is willing to participate, the employer’s share must be added to the employee’s account.  To whom are the ECP addressed? All employees no younger than 18 and no older than 55 are automatically enrolled in the programme. Employees between 55 and 70 years of age who want to join the ECP must submit a written declaration of their willingness to participate in the programme. Persons above the age of 70 cannot join the PPK (but those who were already participants of the ECP can continue their saving within its framework after reaching this age). How are contributions to the ECP made? An employee who joins the programme declares to make contributions of at least 2% of their gross salary, whereas an employer is mandated to contribute at least 1.5% of that gross salary. During the first year, the additional sum of 250 zlotys is transferred to the account (after at least 3 months of the employee’s participation), whereas the annual benefit from the state amounts to 240 zlotys. Can I increase or decrease the amount of my payments to the ECP? Yes, you can. The payment can be reduced to as little as 0.5% of gross salary if the employee’s monthly remuneration does not exceed 120% of the minimum monthly salary. The payment can also be increased by up to 2% of gross salary, which means that an employee can contribute from 2% to 4% of his or her gross salary (or, in special cases, from 0.5% to 4%).  What will be the monthly cost of my participation in the ECP? The basic cost is the declared percentage of gross monthly salary (default 2%) along with the income tax charged on the employer’s contribution (that is, on 1.5% of gross salary). Can I opt out from the programme? How can I do it? The ECP is a voluntary saving programme, so an employee can cancel his or her participation and leave the programme at any time. However, any employee who cancels participation in the ECP will be automatically enrolled in the programme every four years. If the person is still unwilling to make payments, he or she must submit another opt-out declaration. In the case of the University, which became subject to the Act on ECP of 1 January 2021, the first automatic re-enrolment of participants is  scheduled for the beginning of 2023, and will then be repeated every four years. When can I withdraw the money from the account? The ECP is a retirement saving programme, which assumes that all funds are withdrawn after the participant reaches the age of 60. The withdrawal process is divided into stages. 25% of the accumulated funds will be withdrawn at one time, and the remaining 75% - in monthly instalments during the following 10 years. This form of withdrawal after reaching the age of 60 will not entail any additional costs or taxation. An employee who, after receiving 25% of the accumulated funds, wishes to withdraw the remaining 75% in fewer instalments or all at once, will have to pay a tax charge. What if I would like to withdraw my money earlier? As participation in the ECP is not mandatory, the funds can be withdrawn at any moment, but this will entail additional charges. If the money is withdrawn before reaching the age of 60, the amount will be reduced by: The funds can be withdrawn without the deductions in exceptional situations, such as: What will happen to the accumulated funds if the participant dies before the age of 60? The funds accumulated in the ECP are fully inherited pursuant to the general rules of the Polish inheritance law. The beneficiaries can also be appointed by submitting the relevant decision to the investment fund. Will I be able to check the balance of my account? After joining the ECP, the investment fund will contact every participant providing him or her with the login and password to the system, enabling the participant to check the account balance, check how the funds are invested or, possibly, request changes in one’s personal data or investments. What if I have already been enrolled in the ECP by my previous employer? If a new employee was or is the ECP participant as part of another employment, he or she may transfer the previously accumulated funds to one specific investment fund of the selected employer or leave the money at two different investment funds and continue gathering them in two different accounts.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_US/about-university/history", "text": "The Kraków University is the oldest higher education institution in Poland and one of the oldest in Europe. It was founded on 12 May 1364 by the Polish king Casimir the Great. The Studium Generale – as the University was then called – comprised three faculties: of liberal arts, medicine and law. Only the former two were active during the founder's life. After the king's death, the University ceased to exist. Following the failed attempts to restore it in the 1390s, the University was re-founded by King Vladislaus Jagiełło on 26 July 1400. Queen Jadwiga, who died in 1399, contributed to the restoration by leaving a considerable portion of her private estate to the University in her last will. The University's structure was already complete in 1397, with the formal establishment of the faculty of theology. The oldest, main college was at first called the Royal Jagiellonian College (Collegium Regium), and then the Greater College (Collegium Maius). The University, located in the then capital of the Kingdom of Poland, never again interrupted its educational and scholarly activity. Not only does it constitute a symbol of continuity of the Polish state, but also places Kraków among the most important educational centres in the country. During the 15th century, the University flourished. It attracted learners from all of Europe – every year, some 200 new students enroled. Aside from Poles, the University was also attended by Ruthenians, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Germans, Czechs, the Swiss, the English, the Dutch, the French, the Spanish, Italians, and even Tartars. It was known for providing education in the fields of law, mathematics and astronomy. Among the professors of this age there were two brilliant lawyers – Stanisław of Skarbimierz and Paweł Włodkowic (Paulus Vladimiri) – as well as great mathematicians, astronomers and geographers: Marcin Król of Żurawica, Jan of Głogów, Wojciech of Brudzewo, Maciej of Miechów. The world famous astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus enroled as a student in 1491. The second half of the 16th century brought crisis. The Reformation and religious division of Europe combined with the creation of many new universities led to a decrease in the influx of foreign students. In Poland admission to important offices was restricted to nobility without a higher education prerequisite, which caused the University to acquire a bourgeois character. In this area, it competed with the new universities in Vilnius and Zamość as well as Jesuit schools. In spite of that, later Polish statesmen, bishops and writers, such as Mikołaj Rej, Jan Kochanowski, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski, Stanisław Hozjusz and Marcin Kromer studied in this period at the University, which as of late 16th century became known as Kraków Academy. The 17th century was dominated by the struggle between the Academy and the Jesuits, who desired to seize control of education in Kraków. During that time, the Academy also created a highly developed school system dependent on it (known as the \"academic colonies\"). Among the scholars of that century, one particularly worth mentioning is the mathematician Jan Brożek. As far as notable students are concerned, John Sobieski, later king of Poland and victor of the 1683 Relief of Vienna, graduated from the Academy in that period. The establishment of the Commission for National Education in 1773 ushered in a new epoch in the history of the Kraków University. The Commission was the first state body the chief aim of which was the reconstruction of the educational system in Poland. Hugo Kołłątaj was appointed as the reform's executor. He restructured the University during the years 1777–1786. He replaced the four original faculties with two colleges: the Collegium Morale (theology, law and literature) and the Collegium Physicum (mathematics, physics and medicine). He introduced lectures in Polish (with the exception of theology), brought in distinguished scholars (including mathematician and astronomer Jan Śniadecki), furthered the development of natural and exact sciences, and initiated the construction of the astronomical observatory, the botanical garden and the university clinic. During the time of the reform, the University changed its name to the Principal School of the Realm. In the following years, the historic circumstances caused the University to change its name yet again – to the Principal School of Kraków. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), Kraków was incorporated into Austria. In 1805, it was joined with Lviv University and Germanised. Re-Polonisation followed in 1809, when Kraków was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Kraków attained the status of an independent state as the Free City of Kraków, in which the university professors gained a considerable political influence. Poles from Austria, Russia and Prussia were welcome to enrol at the University, but the governments of these states hampered the efforts of prospective students. In 1817, the University acquired its modern name: the Jagiellonian University. Following the dissolution of the Free City and the incorporation of Kraków into Austria (1846), the University was reorganised according to the Austrian model and German again became the language of tuition. In the second half of the 19th century, when Austria granted the Poles in Galicia an actual autonomy, crucial changes in the University's situation led to a substantial growth of its scholarly and social significance. Polish was reinstated as the language of tuition. A new main college was erected (Collegium Novum, 1887). There was a rapid development in both sciences and humanities. Several scholars distinguished themselves in diverse academic fields: Józef Szujski and Michał Bobrzyński (known as the creators of the Kraków school of history) in historiography, Stanisław Tarnowski in history of literature, Jan Baudouin de Courtenay in linguistics, Karol Olszewski in chemistry, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Marian Smoluchowski in physics. Students came from the Polish lands of all three partitions and from the Habsburg Monarchy. Apart from Poles, the University attracted Ruthenians, Ukrainians and Belarusians, Czechs, Moravians and other Slavs as well as Jews and Germans – approximately one thousand new students a year. Among them were Bronisław Malinowski, later anthropologist and author of international renown, and Ivo Andrić, later Nobel Laureate in Literature. After Poland regained its independence in 1918 the development of the Jagiellonian University continued. Over 4 thousand young men and women attended the University. Its importance in that time is evidenced by the names of brilliant philologists (Ignacy Chrzanowski, Kazimierz Nitsch, Tadeusz Sinko), historians (Roman Grodecki, Władysław Konopczyński), archaeologists (Tadeusz Sulimirski), lawyers (Rafał Taubenschlag, Fryderyk Zoll), mathematicians (Stanisław Zaremba, Tadeusz Banachiewicz, Kazimierz Żorawski), chemists (Leon Sternbach Jr., Leon Marchlewski), among others. A Faculty of Agriculture was established (1923), and the Jagiellonian Library was erected (1939). During the Second World War, on 6th November 1939, Nazi German authorities deceived nearly 180 scholars and staff members of the Jagiellonian University into gathering in Collegium Novum, then brutally arrested and deported them to concentration camps, where several of them have met their death. Another group of scholars, captured as military officers by the Soviets (who invaded Poland on 17 September 1939), was executed by the order of Joseph Stalin in Katyn (1940). The Nazi Germans closed the University. As a result, clandestine education commenced in 1942 for approximately 800 students. One of them was Karol Wojtyła, who later became pope John Paul II. In 1945, over 5000 students enrolled to the University. Among them was Wisława Szymborska, later poet and Nobel Laureate. It became a safe haven for scholars who had been forced to leave Lviv and Vilnius due to the change of eastern Polish borders as well as those who could not return to Warsaw because of its destruction by Nazi Germans. In the new, communist political reality, the University's structure was subject to many changes. Theological, agricultural and medical faculties were removed. In 1948 the worst period in the post-war history of the Jagiellonian University began – the era of Stalinism. Communist officials prevented some of the well-known scholars from conducting their research, including the philosopher Roman Ingarden, historian Władysław Konopczyński and economist Adam Krzyżanowski. In the following decades political turbulence impacted the history of the Jagiellonian University. The years 1968 and 1981 witnessed waves of student demonstrations against the regime. Regardless of this, the Jagiellonian University remained an institution where distinguished scholars continued their work in the academic fields of Polish studies (Juliusz Kleiner, Stanisław Pigoń, Kazimierz Wyka), history (Jan Dąbrowski, Henryk Wereszycki), botany (Henryk Niewodniczański), psychology (Stefan Szuman), legal history (Adam Vetulani), law (Ludwik Ehrlich), linguistics (Jerzy Kuryłowicz), astronomy (Kazimierz Kordylewski), molecular biology (Jan Zurzycki), and mathematics (Tadeusz Ważewski, Franciszek Leja, Stanisław Gołąb, Jacek Szarski). Currently the Jagiellonian University comprises fifteen faculties, including three medical ones, which were reincorporated into the University in 1993 and now form the Medical College. A new Campus of the 600th Anniversary of the Jagiellonian University Revival is under construction. Approximately 50 thousand students attend the university each year; 65% of them are women. Aside from students from the European Union, the University is also attended by visitors from Africa and Asia as well as new states of the Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Belarus). Today the University employs 3.8 thousand academic staff, including over 650 professors, as well as about 3.5 thousand other staff members, while providing education to about 40 thousand students. Therefore, the impression that an institution like ours creates must properly reflect its presence in the social life of Poland, its timelessness and unwavering symbolism. Because of this, large scale investments are being financed, such as: the continued expansion of the Campus of the 600th Anniversary of the Jagiellonian University Revival, where the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science has recently been relocated, the construction of new quarters for the Faculty of Chemistry, the continued construction of the Centre for Natural Sciences Education and the Institute of Geology, restoration and expansion of Collegium Paderevianum for the Faculty of Philology and the thorough renovation of Collegium Novum and the streets of the \"university quarter\". We constantly improve and expand our infrastructure to create an ever better environment for scholarly research, teaching and learning. Funds for the abovementioned investments are acquired from various sources, e.g. the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the European Union, the Municipality of Kraków, the Civic Committe for the Restoration of Kraków Heritage Sites as well as the University itself.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_US/about-university/ju-awards/oswiecim", "text": " The Oświęcim Award for Human Rights of John Paul II was established to pay tribute to the Pope's role as a great advocate of human rights as a basis for the \"civilization of love and solidarity\". It aims to promote the values which are universal in the modern-day world, such as the unalienable dignity of every human being, truth, good and beauty. The words of the Auschwitz martyr, Saint Maximilian Kolbe that \"only love is creative\" are the motto of the Award.    The name \"Oświęcim\" (the Polish town where the German concentration camp Auschwitz was located) and the words of St. Maximilian as a motto are a clear reference to the reality of Auschwitz: a place of planned annihilation of human and humanity, one of the supreme symbols of 20th century totalitarianisms. At the same time, Auschwitz shows that human dignity is inalienable and impossible to destroy by any system and by any hatred. This human dignity, rooted in the spiritual nature of human being is the source of what we call human rights. The memory of the tragedy of Auschwitz cannot be thus directed solely towards the past. On the contrary, it serves as an ever-relevant \"examination of the conscience of mankind\".  The Award serves as a means to creatively develop the Oświęcim legacy of John Paul II. It aims at reviving the reflection upon the idea of human rights. This is also important because of the tendency to distort this idea, which may lead to the instrumental treatment of human beings and their subordination to the political and economic goals, the phenomenon especially strongly present in the modern western civilization within the area of legislation. Hence, it is important not to use human rights as a means of imposing the will of the minority and an instrument of social engineering. On the other hand, each human right is, in practice, limited by other human rights, which makes social compromise necessary and encourages people who think differently to meet and talk. Yet, this always has to be a meeting of truth and respect, a meeting oriented towards values. From this historic, ethical, and anthropological perspective the real goal of the Award emerges: to pay tribute to the people whose life and activity have proved that this is the real sense of human rights.   The contest is organized by the Board of Trustees of the Oświęcim Award for Human Rights of John Paul II.

The increased frequency and complexity of health threats require a different, unified form of preparedness and a coordinated, fast, reliable and effective emergency response.  DURABLE is a tailored solution to this recognised need - a strong network of world-class basic and translational research institutes and public health centres across Europe with an outstanding track record in public health support with global reach. DURABLE aims to provide high-quality scientific information in record time to support HERA’s decision-making in preparing for and responding to cross-border health threats and assessing the impact of countermeasures. DURABLE will coordinate a global collaboration, from pathogen detection, evolutionary analysis and threat characterisation, with One Health approach, to data and information collection and sharing, for optimal threat response. DURABLE is a unique multidisciplinary consortium with complementary expertise to meet this challenge and build productive interactions with HERA and other stakeholders. Due to their outstanding track record and experience in the field, the DURABLE consortium is competent from day one. DURABLE will develop and validate a roadmap for rapid deployment of key countermeasures, test the robustness of the network, and assess key aspects of its emergency mode when simula­ting or dealing with identified threats. Additionally, DURABLE will focus on long-term sustainability by focusing on capacity building, training the next generation of researchers and developing pandemic preparedness training modules for the network and beyond.

Václav Malý (born September 21, 1950 in Prague), an auxiliary bishop of Prague, the former spokesman for the Charter 77, a defender of human rights. From 1969 to 1976 he attended the seminary in Litoměřice. On June 26, 1976 he was ordained priest. In 1977 he signed Charter 77. Two years later, the Communist authorities forbade him to perform priestly duties and put him to prison for 7 months. Between 1980 and 1989 he worked physically as a stoker, at the same time secretly performing priestly duties. From January 13, 1981 to January 7, 1982 he was the spokesman for Charter 77, and later he co-founded the Civic Forum (Občanské forum). He played one of the key roles in the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia in 1989. Between 1990 and 1996 he was the parish priest in the St. Anthony's Church in Holešovice, Prague. On 1 December 1996 John Paul II appointed him auxiliary bishop of Prague. His motto as a bishop is \"Humility and Truth\". He is also an ardent defender of human rights, who visits countries ruled by totalitarian regimes, such as Belarus, Cuba, China, Iran and Chechnya, where he meets with opposition members, speaks up for political prisoners and supports their families.            Stefan Wilkanowicz (born January 3, 1924 in Warsaw), a Polish journalist, columnist and a Catholic activist, a philosopher and an engineer by profession. He was one of the founders of the Clubs of Catholic Intelligentsia in Warsaw and Krakow. Since 1957 he has been cooperating with Znak publishing company and with Tygodnik Powszechny weekly. From 1978 to 1994 he was the editor-in-chief of Znak monthly. As a catholic activist, he presided over the Apostolic Lay Commission of the Pastoral Synod of the Krakow Archdiocese. Between 1977 and 1979 he was the member of the Pontifical Council for the Laity. Since 1993 he has been the Vice-Chairman of the National Council of Catholic Laity. Besides, he is the Deputy Chairman of the International Auschwitz Council and the head of its Education Committee, the Chairman of the Council of the International Center for Education about Auschwitz and the Holocaust, the Deputy Chairman of the Polish Committee for UNESCO (since 1999) and the Chairman of the Board of Znak Christian Culture Foundation. He has written several books and a number of articles on Christianity and was the main author of the preamble to the present Polish Constitution. His achievements include a number of initiatives designed to promote Polish-Jewish and Polish-German dialogue. He was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta, the Order of St. Sylvester as well as numerous prizes.  In 2009 the Award went to André Glucksmann (France).  André Glucksmann (born June 19, 1937 in Boulogne-Billancourt), a French writer and philosopher of Jewish origin, a member of the Nouvelle philosophie movement. One of the most distinguished philosophers and non-fiction writers of the modern day. In his books he often deals with the issue of cruelty. He is an ardent proponent of the attitude of commitment, both in thinking and in politics. He belongs to the generation of French intellectuals, who rebelled against the dominant Marxism in the 1970s. His philosophical views have been based on deep moral sensitivity to harm and suffering. He tries to communicate this sort of sensitivity to his readers, encouraging them to reflect upon human suffering inflicted by other human beings.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_US/about-university/overview", "text": " The Jagiellonian University is the oldest higher education institution in Poland and one of the oldest in Europe. It was founded on 12 May 1364 by the Polish king Casimir the Great. The Jubilee year 2014 marked the 650th anniversary of this remarkable event.  Since its very beginning, the Jagiellonian University has been an international institution. Poles, Ruthenians, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Germans, Czechs, the Swiss, the English, the Dutch, the French the Spanish, Italians, and even Tatars studied here in the old days. Further development of the University has been inextricably bound with the turbulent and often tragic history of Poland. The institution managed to survive both the partitions of Poland by Russia, Prussia and Austria, and the two world wars, serving as a guardian of Polish culture and identity and educating successive generations of Poles, as well as members of other nations, significantly contributing to the intellectual heritage of Europe. Some of the Jagiellonian University students and academics have been major historical figures, including world famous scholars, such as Nicolaus Copernicus or Karol Olszewski, as well as Karol Wojtyła, the future Pope John Paul II. Today, the Jagiellonian University comprises 16 Faculties, where nearly 4 thousand academic staff conduct research and provide education to almost 40 thousand students, within the framework of more than 150 different fields of study. Eminent researchers and state-of-the-art infrastructure make the JU one of the leading Polish scientific institutions, collaborating with major academic centres from all over the world. The Jagiellonian University is also home to numerous student research societies, where young researchers pursue their academic interests and develop friendships with people who share their passion. The university's prestige in both Poland and abroad is illustrated by its widely recognised research achievements. The scientists and physicians from the JU Medical College carry out pioneer studies, e.g. in cardiac surgery, urology and neurology, often leading to the development of novel treatment methods. Their findings have been published in some of the most prestigious international journals, for instance European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, and Lancet. JU archaeologists explore the secrets of ancient sites in various parts of the world, including Egypt, Cyprus, Central America, South Asia and Altay. The astronomers take part in the most important international projects in their field, including H.E.S.S. and VIPERS, whereas the results of research by JU biotechnologists have been published in such reputable specialist journals as Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, Molecular Ecology Resources or European Journal of Human Genetics. These are only some examples of remarkable successes for which the Jagiellonian University has been famous in recent years. The most unique large-scale projects run by the Jagiellonian University include the Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics, Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology, OMICRON, and National Synchrotron Radiation Centre SOLARIS. Yet another advantage of the Jagiellonian University is its location in the historic city of Kraków, the former capital of Poland and a great cultural centre, visited by millions of tourists. Some of the University buildings are major historical sites themselves.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/about-university/history", "text": "The Kraków University is the oldest higher education institution in Poland and one of the oldest in Europe. It was founded on 12 May 1364 by the Polish king Casimir the Great. The Studium Generale – as the University was then called – comprised three faculties: of liberal arts, medicine and law. Only the former two were active during the founder's life. After the king's death, the University ceased to exist. Following the failed attempts to restore it in the 1390s, the University was re-founded by King Vladislaus Jagiełło on 26 July 1400. Queen Jadwiga, who died in 1399, contributed to the restoration by leaving a considerable portion of her private estate to the University in her last will. The University's structure was already complete in 1397, with the formal establishment of the faculty of theology. The oldest, main college was at first called the Royal Jagiellonian College (Collegium Regium), and then the Greater College (Collegium Maius). The University, located in the then capital of the Kingdom of Poland, never again interrupted its educational and scholarly activity. Not only does it constitute a symbol of continuity of the Polish state, but also places Kraków among the most important educational centres in the country. During the 15th century, the University flourished. It attracted learners from all of Europe – every year, some 200 new students enroled. Aside from Poles, the University was also attended by Ruthenians, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Germans, Czechs, the Swiss, the English, the Dutch, the French, the Spanish, Italians, and even Tartars. It was known for providing education in the fields of law, mathematics and astronomy. Among the professors of this age there were two brilliant lawyers – Stanisław of Skarbimierz and Paweł Włodkowic (Paulus Vladimiri) – as well as great mathematicians, astronomers and geographers: Marcin Król of Żurawica, Jan of Głogów, Wojciech of Brudzewo, Maciej of Miechów. The world famous astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus enroled as a student in 1491. The second half of the 16th century brought crisis. The Reformation and religious division of Europe combined with the creation of many new universities led to a decrease in the influx of foreign students. In Poland admission to important offices was restricted to nobility without a higher education prerequisite, which caused the University to acquire a bourgeois character. In this area, it competed with the new universities in Vilnius and Zamość as well as Jesuit schools. In spite of that, later Polish statesmen, bishops and writers, such as Mikołaj Rej, Jan Kochanowski, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski, Stanisław Hozjusz and Marcin Kromer studied in this period at the University, which as of late 16th century became known as Kraków Academy. The 17th century was dominated by the struggle between the Academy and the Jesuits, who desired to seize control of education in Kraków. During that time, the Academy also created a highly developed school system dependent on it (known as the \"academic colonies\"). Among the scholars of that century, one particularly worth mentioning is the mathematician Jan Brożek. As far as notable students are concerned, John Sobieski, later king of Poland and victor of the 1683 Relief of Vienna, graduated from the Academy in that period. The establishment of the Commission for National Education in 1773 ushered in a new epoch in the history of the Kraków University. The Commission was the first state body the chief aim of which was the reconstruction of the educational system in Poland. Hugo Kołłątaj was appointed as the reform's executor. He restructured the University during the years 1777–1786. He replaced the four original faculties with two colleges: the Collegium Morale (theology, law and literature) and the Collegium Physicum (mathematics, physics and medicine). He introduced lectures in Polish (with the exception of theology), brought in distinguished scholars (including mathematician and astronomer Jan Śniadecki), furthered the development of natural and exact sciences, and initiated the construction of the astronomical observatory, the botanical garden and the university clinic. During the time of the reform, the University changed its name to the Principal School of the Realm. In the following years, the historic circumstances caused the University to change its name yet again – to the Principal School of Kraków. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), Kraków was incorporated into Austria. In 1805, it was joined with Lviv University and Germanised. Re-Polonisation followed in 1809, when Kraków was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Kraków attained the status of an independent state as the Free City of Kraków, in which the university professors gained a considerable political influence. Poles from Austria, Russia and Prussia were welcome to enrol at the University, but the governments of these states hampered the efforts of prospective students. In 1817, the University acquired its modern name: the Jagiellonian University. Following the dissolution of the Free City and the incorporation of Kraków into Austria (1846), the University was reorganised according to the Austrian model and German again became the language of tuition. In the second half of the 19th century, when Austria granted the Poles in Galicia an actual autonomy, crucial changes in the University's situation led to a substantial growth of its scholarly and social significance. Polish was reinstated as the language of tuition. A new main college was erected (Collegium Novum, 1887). There was a rapid development in both sciences and humanities. Several scholars distinguished themselves in diverse academic fields: Józef Szujski and Michał Bobrzyński (known as the creators of the Kraków school of history) in historiography, Stanisław Tarnowski in history of literature, Jan Baudouin de Courtenay in linguistics, Karol Olszewski in chemistry, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Marian Smoluchowski in physics. Students came from the Polish lands of all three partitions and from the Habsburg Monarchy. Apart from Poles, the University attracted Ruthenians, Ukrainians and Belarusians, Czechs, Moravians and other Slavs as well as Jews and Germans – approximately one thousand new students a year. Among them were Bronisław Malinowski, later anthropologist and author of international renown, and Ivo Andrić, later Nobel Laureate in Literature. After Poland regained its independence in 1918 the development of the Jagiellonian University continued. Over 4 thousand young men and women attended the University. Its importance in that time is evidenced by the names of brilliant philologists (Ignacy Chrzanowski, Kazimierz Nitsch, Tadeusz Sinko), historians (Roman Grodecki, Władysław Konopczyński), archaeologists (Tadeusz Sulimirski), lawyers (Rafał Taubenschlag, Fryderyk Zoll), mathematicians (Stanisław Zaremba, Tadeusz Banachiewicz, Kazimierz Żorawski), chemists (Leon Sternbach Jr., Leon Marchlewski), among others. A Faculty of Agriculture was established (1923), and the Jagiellonian Library was erected (1939). During the Second World War, on 6th November 1939, Nazi German authorities deceived nearly 180 scholars and staff members of the Jagiellonian University into gathering in Collegium Novum, then brutally arrested and deported them to concentration camps, where several of them have met their death. Another group of scholars, captured as military officers by the Soviets (who invaded Poland on 17 September 1939), was executed by the order of Joseph Stalin in Katyn (1940). The Nazi Germans closed the University. As a result, clandestine education commenced in 1942 for approximately 800 students. One of them was Karol Wojtyła, who later became pope John Paul II. In 1945, over 5000 students enrolled to the University. Among them was Wisława Szymborska, later poet and Nobel Laureate. It became a safe haven for scholars who had been forced to leave Lviv and Vilnius due to the change of eastern Polish borders as well as those who could not return to Warsaw because of its destruction by Nazi Germans. In the new, communist political reality, the University's structure was subject to many changes. Theological, agricultural and medical faculties were removed. In 1948 the worst period in the post-war history of the Jagiellonian University began – the era of Stalinism. Communist officials prevented some of the well-known scholars from conducting their research, including the philosopher Roman Ingarden, historian Władysław Konopczyński and economist Adam Krzyżanowski. In the following decades political turbulence impacted the history of the Jagiellonian University. The years 1968 and 1981 witnessed waves of student demonstrations against the regime. Regardless of this, the Jagiellonian University remained an institution where distinguished scholars continued their work in the academic fields of Polish studies (Juliusz Kleiner, Stanisław Pigoń, Kazimierz Wyka), history (Jan Dąbrowski, Henryk Wereszycki), botany (Henryk Niewodniczański), psychology (Stefan Szuman), legal history (Adam Vetulani), law (Ludwik Ehrlich), linguistics (Jerzy Kuryłowicz), astronomy (Kazimierz Kordylewski), molecular biology (Jan Zurzycki), and mathematics (Tadeusz Ważewski, Franciszek Leja, Stanisław Gołąb, Jacek Szarski). Currently the Jagiellonian University comprises fifteen faculties, including three medical ones, which were reincorporated into the University in 1993 and now form the Medical College. A new Campus of the 600th Anniversary of the Jagiellonian University Revival is under construction. Approximately 50 thousand students attend the university each year; 65% of them are women. Aside from students from the European Union, the University is also attended by visitors from Africa and Asia as well as new states of the Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Belarus). Today the University employs 3.8 thousand academic staff, including over 650 professors, as well as about 3.5 thousand other staff members, while providing education to about 40 thousand students. Therefore, the impression that an institution like ours creates must properly reflect its presence in the social life of Poland, its timelessness and unwavering symbolism. Because of this, large scale investments are being financed, such as: the continued expansion of the Campus of the 600th Anniversary of the Jagiellonian University Revival, where the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science has recently been relocated, the construction of new quarters for the Faculty of Chemistry, the continued construction of the Centre for Natural Sciences Education and the Institute of Geology, restoration and expansion of Collegium Paderevianum for the Faculty of Philology and the thorough renovation of Collegium Novum and the streets of the \"university quarter\". We constantly improve and expand our infrastructure to create an ever better environment for scholarly research, teaching and learning. Funds for the abovementioned investments are acquired from various sources, e.g. the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the European Union, the Municipality of Kraków, the Civic Committe for the Restoration of Kraków Heritage Sites as well as the University itself.

The increased frequency and complexity of health threats require a different, unified form of preparedness and a coordinated, fast, reliable and effective emergency response.  DURABLE is a tailored solution to this recognised need - a strong network of world-class basic and translational research institutes and public health centres across Europe with an outstanding track record in public health support with global reach. DURABLE aims to provide high-quality scientific information in record time to support HERA’s decision-making in preparing for and responding to cross-border health threats and assessing the impact of countermeasures. DURABLE will coordinate a global collaboration, from pathogen detection, evolutionary analysis and threat characterisation, with One Health approach, to data and information collection and sharing, for optimal threat response. DURABLE is a unique multidisciplinary consortium with complementary expertise to meet this challenge and build productive interactions with HERA and other stakeholders. Due to their outstanding track record and experience in the field, the DURABLE consortium is competent from day one. DURABLE will develop and validate a roadmap for rapid deployment of key countermeasures, test the robustness of the network, and assess key aspects of its emergency mode when simula­ting or dealing with identified threats. Additionally, DURABLE will focus on long-term sustainability by focusing on capacity building, training the next generation of researchers and developing pandemic preparedness training modules for the network and beyond. WP1 will develop a joint consortium communication strategy and tools, and a data management plan. WP2 will deliver a comprehensive model of the lab network structure, a governance and sustainability plan, a stakeholder analysis and KPIs and scenario exercises. WP3 will map the core network, the links with research consortia and other initiatives, and the extended international network of the individual partners and possible future initiatives. WP4 will develop a toolbox facilitating the broader surveillance, and prepositioned sampling protocols. WP5 will develop new state-of-the-art in vitro and ex-vivo laboratory systems to study virus infections, and new assays to determine phenotypic traits. WP6 will develop assays and run screening campaigns with 250,000 compounds to identify hits (Hits that block replication are interesting as tool compounds supporting mechanistic studies). WP7 will develop and provide a new database, and a new generation of analytical tools for pathogen and outbreak tracking. WP8 will develop new mathematical models and a comprehensive analytical framework supporting risk assessments. WP9 will facilitate the rapid roll out of essential assays in case of new discoveries through WP4 or from outside of the consortium. WP10 will deliver three Project Schools, webinars and comprehensive training materials. WP11 will develop a protocol for a coordinated response to emergencies. 1.

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/about-university/ju-awards/oswiecim", "text": " The Oświęcim Award for Human Rights of John Paul II was established to pay tribute to the Pope's role as a great advocate of human rights as a basis for the \"civilization of love and solidarity\". It aims to promote the values which are universal in the modern-day world, such as the unalienable dignity of every human being, truth, good and beauty. The words of the Auschwitz martyr, Saint Maximilian Kolbe that \"only love is creative\" are the motto of the Award.    The name \"Oświęcim\" (the Polish town where the German concentration camp Auschwitz was located) and the words of St. Maximilian as a motto are a clear reference to the reality of Auschwitz: a place of planned annihilation of human and humanity, one of the supreme symbols of 20th century totalitarianisms. At the same time, Auschwitz shows that human dignity is inalienable and impossible to destroy by any system and by any hatred. This human dignity, rooted in the spiritual nature of human being is the source of what we call human rights. The memory of the tragedy of Auschwitz cannot be thus directed solely towards the past. On the contrary, it serves as an ever-relevant \"examination of the conscience of mankind\".  The Award serves as a means to creatively develop the Oświęcim legacy of John Paul II. It aims at reviving the reflection upon the idea of human rights. This is also important because of the tendency to distort this idea, which may lead to the instrumental treatment of human beings and their subordination to the political and economic goals, the phenomenon especially strongly present in the modern western civilization within the area of legislation. Hence, it is important not to use human rights as a means of imposing the will of the minority and an instrument of social engineering. On the other hand, each human right is, in practice, limited by other human rights, which makes social compromise necessary and encourages people who think differently to meet and talk. Yet, this always has to be a meeting of truth and respect, a meeting oriented towards values. From this historic, ethical, and anthropological perspective the real goal of the Award emerges: to pay tribute to the people whose life and activity have proved that this is the real sense of human rights.   The contest is organized by the Board of Trustees of the Oświęcim Award for Human Rights of John Paul II.

André Glucksmann (born June 19, 1937 in Boulogne-Billancourt), a French writer and philosopher of Jewish origin, a member of the Nouvelle philosophie movement. One of the most distinguished philosophers and non-fiction writers of the modern day. In his books he often deals with the issue of cruelty. He is an ardent proponent of the attitude of commitment, both in thinking and in politics. He belongs to the generation of French intellectuals, who rebelled against the dominant Marxism in the 1970s. His philosophical views have been based on deep moral sensitivity to harm and suffering. He tries to communicate this sort of sensitivity to his readers, encouraging them to reflect upon human suffering inflicted by other human beings. This sensitivity makes him horrified by the cruelty, present throughout the history on nearly all fields of human activity. For many years he has been preaching his \"eleventh commandment\": Thou shall not make other people suffer and pursue your goals at their expense, but refrain from evil.   "}

{"link": "https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/about-university/overview", "text": " The Jagiellonian University is the oldest higher education institution in Poland and one of the oldest in Europe. It was founded on 12 May 1364 by the Polish king Casimir the Great. The Jubilee year 2014 marked the 650th anniversary of this remarkable event.  Since its very beginning, the Jagiellonian University has been an international institution. Poles, Ruthenians, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Germans, Czechs, the Swiss, the English, the Dutch, the French the Spanish, Italians, and even Tatars studied here in the old days. Further development of the University has been inextricably bound with the turbulent and often tragic history of Poland. The institution managed to survive both the partitions of Poland by Russia, Prussia and Austria, and the two world wars, serving as a guardian of Polish culture and identity and educating successive generations of Poles, as well as members of other nations, significantly contributing to the intellectual heritage of Europe. Some of the Jagiellonian University students and academics have been major historical figures, including world famous scholars, such as Nicolaus Copernicus or Karol Olszewski, as well as Karol Wojtyła, the future Pope John Paul II. Today, the Jagiellonian University comprises 16 Faculties, where nearly 4 thousand academic staff conduct research and provide education to almost 40 thousand students, within the framework of more than 150 different fields of study. Eminent researchers and state-of-the-art infrastructure make the JU one of the leading Polish scientific institutions, collaborating with major academic centres from all over the world. The Jagiellonian University is also home to numerous student research societies, where young researchers pursue their academic interests and develop friendships with people who share their passion. The university's prestige in both Poland and abroad is illustrated by its widely recognised research achievements. The scientists and physicians from the JU Medical College carry out pioneer studies, e.g. in cardiac surgery, urology and neurology, often leading to the development of novel treatment methods. Their findings have been published in some of the most prestigious international journals, for instance European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, and Lancet. JU archaeologists explore the secrets of ancient sites in various parts of the world, including Egypt, Cyprus, Central America, South Asia and Altay. The astronomers take part in the most important international projects in their field, including H.E.S.S. and VIPERS, whereas the results of research by JU biotechnologists have been published in such reputable specialist journals as Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, Molecular Ecology Resources or European Journal of Human Genetics. These are only some examples of remarkable successes for which the Jagiellonian University has been famous in recent years. The most unique large-scale projects run by the Jagiellonian University include the Jagiellonian Centre for Experimental Therapeutics, Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology, OMICRON, and National Synchrotron Radiation Centre SOLARIS. Yet another advantage of the Jagiellonian University is its location in the historic city of Kraków, the former capital of Poland and a great cultural centre, visited by millions of tourists. Some of the University buildings are major historical sites themselves.

Its aim is to come up with solutions that will enable the cultural tourism to develop without excessively disturbing the daily rhythm of life of residents. The project involves researchers from the JU Faculty of Management and Social Communication.  The winners of the 2024–25 STEM Impact Award programme have been announced by the Polish-American Fulbright Commission. One of them is Dr hab. Jan Boroński, Prof. UJ from the JU Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, who will carry out a research project at the City University of New York.  On 11 December, the oldest Polish university received a delegation from Una Europa – an alliance of 11 leading European universities that aims to establish a close-knit inter-university environment, which would make full use of the potential of its member institutions. One of the goals of the visit was to plan the next year's General Assembly, which will be organised on 26–28 May by the Jagiellonian University as one of the Una Europa founding members.  Prof. Tomasz Guzik from the Faculty of Medicine at the JU Medical College entered the prestigious list of world’s most cited researchers as the only scholar affiliated with a Polish institution. The JU scholar has been listed in the cross-field category. His academic output consists of 368 publications, including 56 cited more than 100 times. Altogether, his works have so far been cited 24.5 thousand times.  On 5 December 2024 at a special session of the Jagiellonian University Senate, the title of doctor honoris causa of the oldest Polish university was awarded to the Prof. Peter Kleinebudde. The German scientist was recognised for his outstanding achievements in research and its application, including implementation of innovative projects in the area of design and production of more effective medications.  The need for and methods of creating at Polish universities a comprehensive, welcoming, and attractive academic environment for international researchers and their families was the topic of the Internationalisation Day \"EURAXESS – Developing Institutional Potential for Welcoming International Researchers\", which took place on 17 December at the Jagiellonian University.  On 21-22 November, the Jagiellonian University hosted a conference entitled ;(Meta-) Data Orchestration: Connecting Manuscript Collections for Innovating Research – \"Berlinka\" in Action'. It was the second in a series of international interdisciplinary conferences organised as part of the Flagship Project 'European Heritage in the Jagiellonian Library: Digital Authoring of the Berlin Collections. Core Facility (DiHeLib)', implemented within the framework of the strategic programme Excellence Initiative at the Jagiellonian University and coordinated by three units: the Faculty of Philology, the Jagiellonian Library, and the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy, and Applied Computer Science.  The latest issue of the prestigious Nature Communications journal features an article \"Systematic, computational discovery of multicomponent and one-pot reactions\", whose co-authors, working under the supervision of Prof. Bartosz Grzybowski, include Dr Sebastian Baś from the Department of Organic Chemistry at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Jagiellonian University.  The journal Advances in Colloid and Interface Science has published a paper summarising the results of the research carried out by a team led by Dr hab. Janusz Dąbrowski, Prof. UJ from the JU Faculty of Chemistry. The paper is a comprehensive study of innovative compounds activated by near-infrared (NIR) photons, which are currently being introduced in diagnostics and cancer treatments.  The latest issue of Nature journal features the article ‘Digestive contents and food webs record the advent of dinosaur supremacy’ co-authored by Dr Artur Górecki and Dr Grzegorz Pacyna from the Institute of Botany at the Faculty of Biology of the Jagiellonian University. The discussed research sheds new light on the evolution and diversification of dinosaurs and the reasons why they dominated terrestrial ecosystems for almost 150 million years.  The trilateral project Enhanced-field spectroscopy on photoactive hybrid metal-semiconductor nanostructures received almost two million zlotys in funding within the framework of the OPUS 26+LAP/Weave call. The Polish group is led by Prof. Kamilla Małek from the JU Department of Chemical Physics. The research will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from Charles University in Prague and Eberhard Charles University in Tübingen.  Researchers from the JU Małopolska Centre of Biotechnology together with colleagues from Durham University and the John Innes Centre have achieved a breakthrough in understanding DNA gyrase. This enzyme, present in bacteria but absent in humans, plays a crucial role in supercoiling DNA, a necessary process for bacterial survival. Using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, the researchers reveal unprecedented detail of gyrase’s action on DNA, potentially opening doors for new antibiotic therapies against resistant bacteria.  A miner’s work carries a lot of risk. The conditions inside the mine tunnels are hard, including high temperatures, humidity, and noise. The miners also face a danger of explosion of the accumulated methane, which, consequently, needs to be removed from underground. Despite many modern safety measures, the release of methane remains one of the key problems of mining industry, especially in the face of the planned EU directive effectively banning the emission of this gas to the atmosphere. Does this mean the end of methane emitting mines in Poland?  Can you present the essence of your research in just three minutes? Can you create a single, static slide that effectively conveys the core message of your doctoral dissertation? Are you able to explain your research to a general audience? Can you describe how your discoveries will contribute to changing the world?
